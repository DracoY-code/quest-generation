    "This notebook covers the performance evaluation of the various pre-trained _large language models_ (LLMs) trained on the prepared [\"quest\"](../data/quests_train.json) dataset. This evaluation is done through the training log dumps by employing various metrics like [ADD METRICS HERE]. A human evaluation method is also prepared to manually test various properties (e.g., [ADD PROPERTIES HERE]) of the quests generated through the LLMs.\n"
