\chapter{Format for the Quest Dataset}
\label{appendix:quest-dataset}

This appendix presents the formal specification of the quest dataset used in this work. The
dataset consists of structured representations of RPG-style quests, annotated and stored
in machine-readable formats. These formats are essential for supervised fine-tuning and
inference using LLMs. Two formats are used: a native JSON representation for
data storage and preprocessing, and a structured prompt format in XML-like syntax for
training autoregressive LLMs.

\section*{JSON Format Specification}

The primary dataset is stored in JSON, where each quest is an object containing fields
such as the quest giver, objectives, task list, reward structure, and other metadata. This
format is optimal for parsing and preprocessing during the data pipeline. A sample entry is
provided below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption={Sample Quest Dataset Format (JSON)}]
{
  "name": "Kill Razor",
  "objective": "Eliminate Razor, the leader of the Blades.",
  "first_tasks": [
    "Locate Razor in Adytum.",
    "Engage and eliminate Razor."
  ],
  "first_task_locations": [
    {
      "name": "Adytum",
      "description": "A settlement in the Boneyard where the Blades reside."
    }
  ],
  "quest_giver": {
    "name": "The Regulators",
    "description": "A militia-like group controlling Adytum, enforcing their own brand of order.",
    "location": "Adytum"
  },
  "reward": [
    {
      "name": "Caps",
      "description": "A monetary reward for completing the task.",
      "amount": 0
    },
    {
      "name": "Favor with the Regulators",
      "description": "Increased reputation with the Regulators for carrying out their orders."
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    "Weapons",
    "Armor"
  ],
  "description": "The Regulators of Adytum have ordered the assassination of Razor, the leader of the Blades. You must locate and kill her.",
  "items": "NONE",
  "characters": "NONE",
  "groups": "NONE",
  "locations": "NONE",
  "enemies": "NONE",
  "title": "Fallout",
  "motivation": "NONE"
}
\end{lstlisting}

  \label{table:field-desc}
\end{table}

Each field in the JSON object plays a specific role in guiding the training, fine-tuning,
or evaluation of large language models, providing structured context and supervision for
generation tasks. The various field descriptions for the \textit{Quest} dataset are given in
Table~\ref{table:field-desc}.

\section*{XML-like Prompt Format for Autoregressive LLMs}

For training decoder-only transformer models in a CLM setting, quests are converted into
a structured prompt format using XML-like tags. This format is designed to align with
tokenization behavior and provide field-level structure to aid in model learning.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=xml, caption={Sample Quest Dataset Format (XML-like)}]
<|begin_quest|>
<|begin_objective|>
Eliminate Razor, the leader of the Blades.
<|end_objective|>
<|begin_tasks|>
Locate Razor in Adytum.
Engage and eliminate Razor.
<|end_tasks|>
<|begin_quest_giver|>
The Regulators: A militia-like group controlling Adytum, enforcing their own brand of order.
<|end_quest_giver|>
<|begin_task_locations|>
Adytum: A settlement in the Boneyard where the Blades reside.
<|end_task_locations|>
<|begin_rewards|>
Caps: A monetary reward for completing the task. (amount: 0)
Favor with the Regulators: Increased reputation with the Regulators for carrying out their orders. (amount: NONE)
<|end_rewards|>
<|end_quest|>
<|begin_description|>
The Regulators of Adytum have ordered the assassination of Razor, the leader of the Blades. You must locate and kill her.
<|end_description|>
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{Use in Training and Inference}

The structured prompt aids both training (aligning fields with their values) and generation
(where the model completes a partial prompt based on learned patterns).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption={Sample Prompt-Response Input Format (JSON)}]
{
  "prompt": "<|begin_quest|>\n<|begin_objective|>\nEliminate Razor, the leader of the Blades.\n<|end_objective|>\n<|begin_tasks|>\nLocate Razor in Adytum.\nEngage and eliminate Razor.\n<|end_tasks|>\n<|begin_quest_giver|>\nThe Regulators: A militia-like group controlling Adytum, enforcing their own brand of order.\n<|end_quest_giver|>\n<|begin_task_locations|>\nAdytum: A settlement in the Boneyard where the Blades reside.\n<|end_task_locations|>\n<|begin_rewards|>\nCaps: A monetary reward for completing the task. (amount: 0)\nFavor with the Regulators: Increased reputation with the Regulators for carrying out their orders. (amount: NONE)\n<|end_rewards|>\n<|end_quest|>\n",
  "response": "The Regulators of Adytum have ordered the assassination of Razor, the leader of the Blades. You must locate and kill her."
}
\end{lstlisting}
