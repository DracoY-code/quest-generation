  \caption{List of pre-trained models used throughout the experimental setup}
  \label{table:models-used}
\end{table}

The models utilized in this study include pre-trained architectures from the OpenAI and
Meta AI research communitiesâ€”specifically, GPT-2 and various LLaMA variants. These
models were selected for their balance between accessibility, architectural diversity, and
performance on text generation tasks. A summary of the models used is presented in
Table~\ref{table:models-used}. Each model was initially pre-trained on large-scale corpora (e.g., the WebText
dataset for GPT-2) and subsequently fine-tuned for the domain-specific task of procedural
quest generation. This fine-tuning involved custom prompt formats, tailored tokenization
procedures, and controlled training conditions to align model behavior with the narrative
and structural conventions of RPG quests.

\section*{Preprocessing Steps}

  \caption{Data preprocessing steps applied to the raw quest data before training}
  \label{table:data-process}
\end{table}

Before initiating fine-tuning, the raw quest dataset was subjected to a comprehensive
preprocessing pipeline. These preprocessing steps were essential to transform the heterogeneous
data into a format compatible with transformer-based language models. They
included token normalization, metadata formatting, placeholder injection, and prompt-construction
tailored to the structure of RPG quest narratives. The aim was to enhance
the quality, consistency, and structural alignment of training samples, thereby improving
training convergence and model performance. An overview of these preprocessing steps is
provided in Table~\ref{table:data-process}.

\section*{Hyperparameters for Training}

\end{table}

Fine-tuning hyperparameters were carefully selected to balance model convergence speed,
training stability, and generalization performance. Key parameters such as batch size,
learning rate, number of training steps, weight decay, and evaluation intervals were tuned
based on preliminary experiments and resource availability. These parameters, detailed in
Table~\ref{table:training-setup}, played a central role in enabling efficient and stable learning across all models.

\section*{Hyperparameters for Generation}

  \begin{tabularx}{0.95\textwidth}{
    >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{4cm}
    >{\centering\arraybackslash}p{3cm}
    >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X
  }
    \toprule
    \textbf{Hyperparameter} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \midrule

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Hyperparameter settings employed during the text generation phase}
  \label{table:generation-setup}
\end{table}

Following fine-tuning, the text generation phase employed a set of decoding hyperparameters
to control the style, diversity, and structure of the model outputs. Parameters
such as temperature, top-k and top-p sampling thresholds, repetition penalties, and maximum
generation length were configured to produce coherent and contextually appropriate
quest narratives. These generation hyperparameters are summarized in Table~\ref{table:generation-setup}, and
they significantly influenced the creativity and fluency of the resulting quests.

\section*{Fine-Tuning Process}

The fine-tuning of pre-trained language models for PQG required careful planning to
balance ideal practices with the practical constraints of available hardware. This section
first describes the optimal fine-tuning methodology envisioned, followed by the actual
process executed during experimentation.

Ideally, each model would be fine-tuned over multiple epochsâ€”typically three to
fiveâ€”using the full training dataset. After each epoch, validation loss would be evaluated
to monitor generalization and guide early stopping. Model checkpoints would be
saved at every epoch, with the checkpoint having the lowest validation loss selected for
final evaluation. This approach helps avoid both underfitting and overfitting, ensuring a
robust trade-off between performance and generalization.

To efficiently train large models, several optimization strategies would be employed.
Mixed precision training (FP16) would reduce memory use and speed up computation,
gradient accumulation would simulate larger batch sizes on limited-memory GPUs, and
gradient checkpointing would lower memory requirements by selectively storing intermediate
activations. Ideally, a multi-GPU or distributed setup would further increase
training throughput, allowing longer training runs, more extensive hyperparameter tuning,
and stable convergence for large architectures like TinyLLaMA, GPT-2, or LLaMA-3
variants.

However, the actual fine-tuning process was limited by hardware constraints. Although
a CUDA-enabled GPU with FP16 support was used, full mixed precision training was
not possible due to compatibility issues, preventing typical gains in memory efficiency
and speed. Gradient checkpointing was enabled to partially mitigate memory bottlenecks
by trading computation time for reduced memory consumption, allowing the training of
larger models within limited resources.

Despite these optimizations, compromises were necessary. Only 90\% of the dataset
was used for both training and evaluation to fit within memory limits, and each model
was trained for a single epoch due to the prohibitive cost of multi-epoch training under
these constraints. Validation loss was computed at the epoch's end, and the corresponding
checkpoint was saved for final evaluation.

Though this setup diverges from the ideal multi-epoch, full-dataset regime, it was
sufficient for comparative analysis. The models learned meaningful task representations,
and performance differences between architectures remained clear. Notably, TinyLLaMA
demonstrated strong generation quality despite minimal fine-tuning, highlighting the effectiveness
of modern compact models in resource-limited environments. This outcome
illustrates that insightful and impactful experimentation is achievable even with constrained
hardware, provided the training process is thoughtfully designed and optimized.

    \toprule
    \textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \midrule
    Perplexity & Measures how well a language model predicts a sample. Lower values indicate better performance. \\
    BLEU & Evaluates n-gram overlap between generated and reference texts; commonly used for machine translation. \\
    METEOR & Considers synonymy and stem matches in addition to exact word matches, offering better alignment with human judgments. \\

  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{List of automated evaluation metrics and their respective roles}
  \label{table:evaluation-metrics}
\end{table}

To evaluate the performance of the models both during and after fine-tuning, a comprehensive
set of evaluation metrics was employed. These metrics (listed in Table~\ref{table:evaluation-metrics})
were chosen to capture various aspects of generation quality, including lexical accuracy,
semantic relevance, fluency, and diversity. Specifically, they were used to measure the
models' effectiveness in producing coherent and contextually appropriate quest narrativesâ€”key
requirements for PCG in role-playing games. The selected metrics provided a
balanced assessment by combining both automated, quantitative indicators and qualitative,
human-centered evaluations.
