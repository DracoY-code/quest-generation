### Description: Hand to Hand training, eh? The real question is, can you fight? You know, throw a good punch? Can you? I'd like to find out if I'm going to spend time working with you. So are you up for a sparring match? I'll make it easy on you. I won't throw a single punch. I just want to see what you've got, anyway. So, is it a deal? If I see you reach for a weapon, I'm calling it off. And if you can actually hurt me, I'll tell you to stop. If this goes on for too long, and I get bored, I'll stop you. Now show me what you've got!
