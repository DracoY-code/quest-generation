### Response:
I, Firebead Elvenhair, have a small errand for you. I left an identify scroll with Tethtoril, in the inner grounds. He should be done examining it by now, so if you could fetch it for me, I'd be grateful. I have a great use for those types of scrolls. Allow me to cast a little spell on you as a reward. It will protect you from any evil you might meet tonight.
