### Description: Eisa's Journal by Eisa Blackthorn  Night shift woke me to say they'd hit something big. Kyr, Ra'jirr, and I went down to take a look. It's huge, like a whole forest was just swallowed up by the earth, with a big old monument out in the center. Kyr took a sword from the monument as a trophy and dubbed it the "Pale Blade", proof his whole plan was finally paying off. For once, he might be right.  Ra'jirr's been having nightmares over the past few days. He keeps muttering about a "Pale Lady" - one of those swamp women who steal children away at night, I think. To think some fool story could turn the toughest bandit I know into a cowering kitten, frightened of his own shadow. I'm just glad none of the others see him like this.  It's getting worse. Ra'jirr can barely sleep at all now, and whenever he dozes off, he wakes up screaming - woke the whole place last night. He says the "Pale Lady" is coming for us - she's down in the forest, we have to return the sword or she'll kill us all. Not a chance - the boss clings to that thing like he was born with it. I've told everyone Ra'jirr just has a fever, but this can't go on. I've pulled a few things together. I'll slip out tonight and never look back.
