Modyn Veleth, Captain of the Redoran Guard at your service. Looking for something to lend a hand with? We have problems aplenty in Raven Rock. Commanding the Redoran Guard can be a difficult task. Even the most experienced warriors can fall prey to petty distractions. They usually didn't amount to much, but they make my job that much harder. Some of my own men have become quite accustomed to a spirit they called 'Emberbrand Wine.' Despise the stuff myself. It's powerful and tremendously addicting... I've seen men fail to finish even a single flask. If I knew where they were stashing the bottles, I'd put an end to it myself. Could you track down the stash? That would be helpful. I just don't have time to do it myself right now. They're too smart to have left it in the Bulwark. I'd search one of the abandoned houses on the outskirts of town.
