### Response:
Have you ever heard of Shalidor? Immensely powerful mage, back in the First Era. Had an understanding of magic few have ever matched. He holed himself up in Labyrinthian, and devoted all of his time to research and study. Wrote more than you would imagine possible. Since then, his writings have been scattered all over Skyrim, but are little use to anyone who can't translate them. I'm one of the few who can. I'm always trying to find more of Shalidor's writings. I've heard whispers of more of his work having turned up. If you can track it down, it may prove useful to all of us.
