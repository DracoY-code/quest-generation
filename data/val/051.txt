<|begin_description|>
I picked up a trick from a master butcher. He showed me a way to grind up ice wraith teeth and use it as a preservative. Keeps everything cold and fresh, but only for a limited time. I'm always looking to replenish my supply, so if you ever come across five of them, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands. The last traveler that traded me some said he found them at a place called Ancient's Ascent. Careful though, rumor has it a dragon makes its home there.
