It seems I'm having a bear problem and I just don't know what to do. I've had attacks on my small flock of sheep lately. I was hoping that building a fence would solve the problem, but it hasn't helped at all. Then, one day when I was just about to step outside, I saw the culprits. A group of West Weald Bears was dragging away a sheep carcass. There's no way I can fight those ferocious beasts off on my own. If you could thin the population a bit, they would probably leave the area. Kill six of the things, bring me their fangs as proof, and I'll reward you well. Please, you're my only hope.
