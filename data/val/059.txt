### Response:
I've deciphered part of the ritual needed to open a portal to Camoran's Paradise. The Mysterium Xarxes mentions four items needed for the ritual, but so far I have only deciphered one of them: the 'blood of a Daedra Lord'. In fact, Daedric artifacts are known to be formed from the essence of a Daedric Lord, from whence they derive their great power. Not an easy thing to come by, obviously, but we will need a Daedric artifact. The only way to obtain a Daedric artifact is through the cults devoted to each of the Daedric Lords. The book "Modern Heretics" is the best introduction to Daedric cults. The library here has a copy if you need it. Bring the artifact to me when you have acquired one. Remember, the Mysterium Xarxes ritual will consume the physical form of the artifact in order to release its Daedric power.
