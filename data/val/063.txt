I have an important task for you. I need you to break into Mercer Frey's home and search for anything that could tell us where he's gone. Mercer's house is in Riften. A gift from the Black-Briars after they kicked the previous family out... a place called Riftweald Manor. He never stays there, just pays for the upkeep on it. Hired some lout by the name of Vald to guard the place. Be careful, kid. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you. Just find a way in, get the information and leave. And you have permission to kill anyone that stands in your way.
