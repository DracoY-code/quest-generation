### Response:
The Stormcloaks need dedicated men and women who're devoted to the cause and willing to die for it. Before I can put you to use, I need to know how much you can take. I have a little test for you. I'm sending you to Serpentstone Isle. If you survive, you pass. If you die, well, you weren't going to be much use to me anyway. It's where men have tested their mettle for ages. There's a strange rock formation, built by the ancients. Something about that place attracts the Ice Wraiths. You kill an Ice Wraith out there, and I'll have all the proof I need about you being Stormcloak material.
