### Description: As a cleric, my duty is to heal the villagers of Woodland Homestead both spiritually and physically. As a hero, your duty is to help people in trouble. I sometimes devise new treatments for various illnesses: some of my experiments are successful, the others, sadly, not so much. I would like you to assist me with an experiment. I also have a volunteer participating in the experiment as well: a depressed man from this very village. I need you to go to the Desolate Plains, the desert just outside this village, and hit that test subject of mine with lightning when there's a thunderstorm. For this, I'm giving you an enchanted trident: you can use it to channel lightning during thunderstorms. Finally, you should report back to me, and let me know what happened. You can keep the trident. May the Gods be with you, hero!
