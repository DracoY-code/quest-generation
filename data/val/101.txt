<|begin_description|>
I'm a botanist, serving the Empire by gathering various Ember-infused plants.  And I've found a virtual treasure trove of Ember Truffles, down in the Muckery... but some of them have already attained sentience, and that's making it difficult for me to gather them. If you can bring me, say, a dozen Ember Truffles, I'll keep ten for the Empire, and I'll use the other two to make a Super Mana Potion for you. Do we have a deal?
