Traveler! Did you know that our dimension is one among many. There exists a dimension called "The End". It is a mysterious place, and supposedly hard to reach. I yearn to know more about that dimension. I have heard vague rumors about fruits native to the End that might teleport you a tiny distance when digested. They are called Chorus Fruits. If you get your hands on six Chorus Fruits, I promise to reward you well with 12 diamonds. Please help a man sate his ever-growing curiosity.
