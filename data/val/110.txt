### Response:
The Silver-Bloods are trying to muscle in on my land. Forsworn attack the mines, and suddenly all these sellswords show up in Karthwasten to 'help.' They won't let anyone work until I sell it off. You can try to convince them to leave, but I'd keep your sword-arm ready if things get ugly.
