I am Dawnlord Arenthis of the church of Lathander... excuse my young charge. Risa doesn't talk much since the recent death of her parents. There is very little that can be done for her as well... other than to put her into an orphanage, I suppose. She is so shy and sad, though, I am sure it will do her no good. If only there were someone who would care for her. Might you know of someone who would make a suitable guardian?
