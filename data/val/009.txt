To tell you the truth, I've been a little distracted. I've got this... idea. I want to ring the whole hall with Rieklings' little spears. Mocking us, from the past. Making us work harder. Fight better. The only problem is, I'm going to need a lot of spears. A lot. So, if you could find a bunch of them for me, that would make it easier on me.
