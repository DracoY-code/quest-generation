<|begin_description|>
Someone has contracted us to kill Beitild. She separated from her husband several months ago. Now the two run competing mining operations in Dawnstar. I hear the mining business is extremely cutthroat. And those hours... they're murder. Beitild's angry and desperate. A fighter.
