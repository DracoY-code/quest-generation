### Description: There is a ruined portal not far from the village. My fellow villagers have seen some ominous-looking people, possibly cultists, near the portal. I am a servant of the Gods: I can't let dark cultists conduct their sinister rituals. I'd like you to investigate these cultists: you are a stranger, thus unknown to them. Who are they? What are their intentions? You should start by heading out to the ruined portal, and spying on those cultists. I have put aside a healing potion for you. Hopefully, you won't need to consume it immediately after your return. Godspeed to you. May you always walk on the path of light.
