I have another job for you. This is not quite in your usual line of work, but I hope you can help me just the same. A rival collector has an item, the Crown of Nenalata, which I very much want to add to my collection. But she stubbornly refuses to consider any of my offers. She and I have had our differences over the years, I admit. Now she is taking this opportunity to get her revenge. I believe that you may be able to persuade her to part with the item, where I cannot due to her prejudice against me. Her name is Herminia Cinna. She lives here in the Imperial City, in the Elven Gardens district. I hope you will succeed where I have so far failed. Afterwards, in order to bring my research on the last king of the Ayleids to its final stage, I need to go to the Throne Room of Nenalata. While I am not without means of defending myself, I believe you would be an invaluable companion on such an expedition. Your reward will be whatever plunder you wish to carry off from Nenalata. Since the Throne Room has been sealed since the time of the Ayleids, it should provide rich pickings.
