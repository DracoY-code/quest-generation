Hello there, I am Lara, and I shall be your tutor. Not that you need schooling, but you might be unfamiliar with the duties you are to perform. In exchange for the many benefits you will enjoy as a favored of Lathander, you will have a few tasks to perform while here. They are humble, but very important. You are to lend your wisdom to the wounded and afflicted, those that are suffering from a misdirection of the heart. Guide them in the light of the Morninglord's glory. We shall introduce you slowly to the work. I shall send you someone that needs the guidance of Lathander, and then we shall evaluate how you have done.
