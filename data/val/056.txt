Hello. I'm Casta Scribonia. The writer. Author of 'Woman Gone Wild'. Who is the fairest of them all? Other than myself? Emfrid, the proprietor of the Grey Mare is lovely. She and Bittneld the Curse-Bringer, the guard captain would be a nice couple.... Perhaps you could bring them together somehow... try talking to them both about each other?
