My name was Sir Juncan. I wish to see you succeed where I failed. I was on the path to the Boots of the Crusader, but died before I reached them. I cannot tell you exactly how to find the Boots, for that will be up to Kynareth. I can tell you to seek out her Priests, though. West of the Imperial City, on the edge of the Great Forest, is a shrine. You will find them there, and they will tell you what you need to know.
