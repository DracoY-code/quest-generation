### Response:
When the Zeraphi and Ezrohir "parted ways," they designated the nearby fortress of Riftkeep as a neutral ground, where they could meet and talk over their differences. But it has remained unused for centuries... until a few weeks ago, when the Ezrohir army seized the fortress. They have occupied it ever since, and that is surely where they are holding the Guardian of Mana while they marshal their forces. The Ezrohir will be expecting the Zeraphi to attack them at Riftkeep, to attempt to rescue the Guardian. But they know it will take time for the Zeraphi to arrive. You can get there much more quickly, and fight your way inside before they are prepared to repel you. Go. Fight past the Ezrohir and free the Guardian!
