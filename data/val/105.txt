### Response:
I should begin with my name... Ginia. I grew up here in Brynnlaw. Things have not always been like this. Brynnlaw was once a pleasant town, though my memories may be influenced by happier times in my own life. Then the pirates arrived, led by the despot Desharik. Desharik had lost a war with another pirate king. Forced to this island, his ships invaded the town. They took our homes. Desharik killed our mayor and dumped his body into the sea. We were forced out into the streets. My father could take no more injustice. He tried to get back into our house and was executed for breaking the law of the pirates. Once they've stolen something, the owner has no claim on it. Desharik said that we would have to pay for our father's "crime." He gave us to Chremy, his lieutenant, as a reward for service. He put me to work as a courtesan for the drunken pirates. It's horrible, traveler! He says that he'll kill my brother Ason if I don't do it. There is no escape for Ason and me. There is a smuggler who will take us, but we cannot afford to pay him. There is nowhere to run on this island. Chremy can be found near the inn. The smuggler's name is Calahan. I hope that Calahan will take us with him when you kill Chremy. He will be near the docks. Please be careful!
