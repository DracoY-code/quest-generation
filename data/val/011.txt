Arrg! Important books are just rotting away in remote places, and no one is doing a damn thing about recovering them. All that precious knowledge... lost forever. Wait. Aren't you that infamous, misbehaving wreck of a person? I'm sorry, I have more important things to worry about than you. Unless, you want to start cleaning up your act. I know for sure that there's this book, "Secrets of the Overworld", just laying around somewhere withing a jungle temple. Just think what moist jungle air is doing to that precious tome of forgotten knowledge! I need to find it, and collect it for me. I can't leave the village myself; no one else can tend my library! I'm willing to pay a lot for the book: 5 blocks of emerald.
