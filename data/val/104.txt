### Response:
Hello! I'm the spiced wine merchant Evette San. You wouldn't have a few minutes to run down to the docks would you? I've got a shipment of spices the East Empire Company is holding up. I need someone to convince them to release it. The person handling shipments is called Vittoria Vici. You should try to talk to her about my shipment. Get back to me when you're done and I'll give you something for your time. I swear it's a fight with them every shipment.
