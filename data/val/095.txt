Aren't I just the handsomest man in this village? I'd like to become even flashier than I am now. Even you, traveler, lack any kind of flashy armor. I could give you my old, crummy diamond chestplate so that you'd look a bit less embarrassing. However, I want you to give me a brand new leather tunic in return.
