### Response:
It appears you have found my body. Very good. This is where my memories are stored â€¦ including the locations of multiple caches of treasure. I could share these with you, if you would help me reacquire the rest of my components. We should begin with my Cognition Linkage. Without that, I won't be able to do much more than repeat this message. My sensors tell me it is somewhere nearby. Find it and reinstall it, and I will direct you to one of those treasure troves.
