### Description: I'm Edla. I have a son. His name is Nikulas. He's a good lad, strong and loyal. I only wish he wasn't so eager to leave the village. I've tried to tell him that the world beyond our lands is dangerous and cruel, but he won't listen. For now, I need Nikulas here. You see, his father, my husband, was recently lost to us. Nikulas is all that I have left in this world. I know it is selfish of me to say so, but I cannot lose him. Not while I still grieve. Also, I know his heart. Nikulas is reckless and foolish, like most young men. He cannot understand what awaits him in the wide world. Could you talk to Nikulas? I know he would listen to you. You've been out there in the wide world. You know its perils.
