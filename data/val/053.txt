### Response:
A contract for you? I, Azzan, think I've got something that suits your experience. Arvena Thelas has some problem with rats in her house. As I said, rats. I'm sure she can explain it to you better than I. She lives here in Anvil. Go and talk to her. Go take care of the rats. Then talk to me. Good luck!
