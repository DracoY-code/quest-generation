### Description: Hello! I thought I heard someone moving around out there. Listen, my name's Medrus. I got ambushed by some raiders, and managed to get clear... but I got pretty badly injured in the process. I can treat it, but I need some Merryweather Leaves. They grow around here, but I'm too weak to look for them. Think you can find some for me, bring 'em back here? You'll be rewarded, I promise.
