I'll tell you anything. Anything! Just please stop... hurting me... I just... can't take the pain. Not a second longer. I'll give you money. Treasure. I have some things hidden away. Take them all. They're yours. Just please... stop. Just north of Windhelm. There's a hollowed-out rock. I have some things hidden in there. Take them! They're yours. I've told you everything I can. I don't know what else you could want...
