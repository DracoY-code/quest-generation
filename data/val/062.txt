### Response:
You disrespected the Dark Brotherhood. And it'll cost you. You want back into the Family, you pay the price. 500 gold, and all is forgiven. I suggest you "collect" it. Until you pay the fine, you are effectively cut off from all Dark Brotherhood duties and contracts. No contracts. No rewards. No respect.
