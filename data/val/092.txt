### Response:
There is always work for the Companions. But there is more personal task before me. Kodlak's final teaching is troubling me. I think he was right about beastblood and Sovngarde. I wish to cleanse myself that I might know glory in the afterlife. Will you help me give up my beasthood? You still bear a head of the Glenmoril betrayers, yes? Then lead on, back to the Tomb of Ysgramor. My soul is now prepared.
