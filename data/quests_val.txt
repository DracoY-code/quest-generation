### Tools: Kyr's bandit gang dug up Frostmere Crypt: Kyr took the Pale Blade from the monument within, Ra'jirr keeps muttering about a Pale Lady, who is going to kill all of Kyr's bandits if they do not return the Pale Blade
### Description: Eisa's Journal by Eisa Blackthorn  Night shift woke me to say they'd hit something big. Kyr, Ra'jirr, and I went down to take a look. It's huge, like a whole forest was just swallowed up by the earth, with a big old monument out in the center. Kyr took a sword from the monument as a trophy and dubbed it the "Pale Blade", proof his whole plan was finally paying off. For once, he might be right.  Ra'jirr's been having nightmares over the past few days. He keeps muttering about a "Pale Lady" - one of those swamp women who steal children away at night, I think. To think some fool story could turn the toughest bandit I know into a cowering kitten, frightened of his own shadow. I'm just glad none of the others see him like this.  It's getting worse. Ra'jirr can barely sleep at all now, and whenever he dozes off, he wakes up screaming - woke the whole place last night. He says the "Pale Lady" is coming for us - she's down in the forest, we have to return the sword or she'll kill us all. Not a chance - the boss clings to that thing like he was born with it. I've told everyone Ra'jirr just has a fever, but this can't go on. I've pulled a few things together. I'll slip out tonight and never look back.

### Description: Come to gawk at the monster? A little girl is dead because of me. Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just... lost control. I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me. It's all on account of this blasted ring. This is the Ring of Hircine. I was told it could let me control my transformations. Perhaps it used to. But I'll never know. Hircine didn't care for my taking it, and threw a curse on it. I put it on... and the changes just came to me. I could never guess when. It would be at the worst times. Like... with the little girl. I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to die in here anyway. I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts under the influence of the moons. I am one of them. A werewolf. It's my secret, and my shame. That's why I wanted the ring... it was said to give men like me control. Now I may look like a man, but I still feel the animal inside of me, as strong as ever. You would take the ring back to Hircine? Oh my. You would do this for me? Here, take it. I don't want anything to do with this wretched thing anymore. Seek out the beast. He wanders these woods. Bring him down and... well, the Lord of the Hunt should smile on you and appear before you. I wish you luck, but should leave here while I still have my skin. Should our paths cross again, I will remember your kindness. Farewell.

### Description: I am Khellor Ahmson, a mere guard. I saw what happened, and I share your helplessness. Any complaints about Officer Roenall must first go THROUGH him, so you can imagine how many get through. This did not come from me, for if my indiscretion against Roenall were to get out, I should be thrown from the military. There is one way you can get to him. Roenall is quite corrupt and more than willing to exercise his power. You are not monitored as we, so you can do something that I or another guard cannot. Look to the docks and a man named Barg. Examine him and what he does, and you are sure to see what I mean. You might also wish to pry into Roenall's personal records. They may reveal something of his fondness for gems. I did not tell you this... and I certainly did not say his records are in his home northwest of the main government building in the Government District. Think on what I've said, and bring anything you learn to Corgeig Axehand in the Government District main building. He is Roenall's commander.

Commanding the Redoran Guard can be a difficult task. Even the most experienced warriors can fall prey to petty distractions. They usually didn't amount to much, but they make my job that much harder. Some of my own men have become quite accustomed to a spirit they called 'Emberbrand Wine.' Despise the stuff myself. It's powerful and tremendously addicting... I've seen men fail to finish even a single flask. If I knew where they were stashing the bottles, I'd put an end to it myself. Could you track down the stash? That would be helpful. I just don't have time to do it myself right now. They're too smart to have left it in the Bulwark.

I'm always looking to replenish my supply, so if you ever come across five of them, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands. The last traveler that traded me some said he found them at a place called Ancient's Ascent. Careful though, rumor has it a dragon makes its home there.

### Description: I've deciphered part of the ritual needed to open a portal to Camoran's Paradise. The Mysterium Xarxes mentions four items needed for the ritual, but so far I have only deciphered one of them: the 'blood of a Daedra Lord'.

Not an easy thing to come by, obviously, but we will need a Daedric artifact. The only way to obtain a Daedric artifact is through the cults devoted to each of the Daedric Lords. The book "Modern Heretics" is the best introduction to Daedric cults. The library here has a copy if you need it. Bring the artifact to me when you have acquired one. Remember, the Mysterium Xarxes ritual will consume the physical form of the artifact in order to release its Daedric power.

I never had any friends; who'd want to spend time with 'the little weird girl who hangs around dead people?' So I grew up with a miserable trade. This is all I know how to do... prepare and inter the deceased. I'd like to make the journey to the Hall of the Dead in Whiterun and give my ceremonial dagger to Andurs, the caretaker. I believe once it's interred with my father's remains I'll be at peace with his memory. A Priest of Arkay is entrusted with a ceremonial dagger once they've completed their training. It's usually given by the head priest who sanctified the ritual. In my case, the head priest happened to be my father. The thing is, I never wanted to follow in his footsteps... In some ways I still don't. I'm entrusting you with the dagger. Bring it to Andurs and he'll take care of the rest.

### Characters: Ungolim - a male Wood Elf Archer, loves a married woman (location: Bravil), Havilstein Hoar-Blood - a horrible man (location: )
### Tools: the player killed Havilstein Hoar-Blood for Lucien Lachance, Ungolim spends his days securely locked inside his house
### Description: Dead Drop Orders #7 by Lucien Lachance  My compliments on another job well done! Havilstein Hoar-Blood was more swine than man, and deserved to die quivering like an animal! You must not stop! You must kill again! Your next target is a Wood Elf named Ungolim, who resides in the city of Bravil. Bravil is also home to an ancient statue known as the Lucky Old Lady. It is seen as a symbol of good luck and prosperity, and the fools of Bravil often speak to the statue and wish for good tidings. Every night, poor lovestruck Ungolim visits the statue and pleads desperately for the heart of a young maiden. This maiden is married, and her husband has learned of Ungolim's affection for his bride. He fears the competition, it would seem, and has commissioned the Dark Brotherhood to help in the matter. You must go to Bravil, locate Ungolim, and kill him. The Wood Elf owns a house in the city, but he spends his days securely locked inside. I recommend you lie in wait at the Lucky Old Lady statue, and then eliminate Ungolim when he arrives for his nightly visit. He's generally there between the hours of 6:00 PM and 1:00 AM. By all accounts, Ungolim is a deadly archer and a fearless opponent. I also have reason to believe he is expecting trouble, so if Ungolim senses danger, he may attack you on sight. Be vigilant, and bring the Wood Elf down! You must not fail! When Ungolim's body lies broken at the foot of his dear statue, you must journey to the city of Anvil. Your dead drop is in a barrel located behind the statue in the pond. As is standard, your reward and next contract will be waiting.

I can't leave the safety of the roof. They have a plan for me, I see it in their eyes. Caldana, Earil, Cutter, ALL OF THEM! They don't know I'm up here, watching. Not much longer, though. At least they won't find me or my stash. I've put all my favorite things in an urn, and sunken it in the sewage near the back of Bernice's dive. I think I'll drink that last bottle to celebrate.

### Description: I should begin with my name... Ginia. I grew up here in Brynnlaw. Things have not always been like this. Brynnlaw was once a pleasant town, though my memories may be influenced by happier times in my own life. Then the pirates arrived, led by the despot Desharik. Desharik had lost a war with another pirate king. Forced to this island, his ships invaded the town. They took our homes. Desharik killed our mayor and dumped his body into the sea. We were forced out into the streets. My father could take no more injustice. He tried to get back into our house and was executed for breaking the law of the pirates. Once they've stolen something, the owner has no claim on it. Desharik said that we would have to pay for our father's "crime." He gave us to Chremy, his lieutenant, as a reward for service. He put me to work as a courtesan for the drunken pirates. It's horrible, traveler! He says that he'll kill my brother Ason if I don't do it. There is no escape for Ason and me. There is a smuggler who will take us, but we cannot afford to pay him. There is nowhere to run on this island. Chremy can be found near the inn. The smuggler's name is Calahan. I hope that Calahan will take us with him when you kill Chremy. He will be near the docks. Please be careful!
