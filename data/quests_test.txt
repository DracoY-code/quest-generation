I've ordered an extra ration of mead, but unless this fighting stops, we'll tear ourselves apart.  11th of First Seed, 4E 201 Rumor is that Herd's gathering followers for a mutiny. Brodir's not stupid; he's probably doing the same, just for insurance. I'd kill them both myself, but the camp's split right down the middle. If I tried, there'd be a knife in my back within a week. I can't take this anymore. I've begun skimming a little gold from the take, bringing it down here when I can. If I can scrape enough together, I'll make a run for it, head downriver to Dragon Bridge.  28th of First Seed, 4E 201 Brodir's getting suspicious -- I caught him poking around in the cove this afternoon. I don't think he found my stash, but it's not safe here. I took the boat out tonight and stowed it on the island to the south, by the old tree stump. Had a good haul this week. Another caravan or two and I can finally get out of here, and not a moment too soon.

### Description: Sad, isn't it? We can't afford to keep the place running since these attacks started. Pirates, you see. Raiding all along the coast, from Hammerfell to Vvardenfell.

I've invested a great deal of time and money acquiring these bits of ancient history. In fact, I'd be so bold as to proclaim my collection the most complete in all Cyrodiil; perhaps even beyond. Except for one thing. A particular relic has eluded me for many years. Possessing this piece of Akaviri antiquity would make my collection complete. I'm of course referring to The Draconian Madstone. The stone is a fine bit of Akaviri craftsmanship. Worn like an amulet, this talisman is said to protect the wearer from poisons of any type. The talisman appears as a snake coiled around and encircling itself. The eyes of the snake are supposed to be precious gems or some such. Through my sources, I've learned that the last reported location of the Draconian Madstone was the ruins at Pale Pass. If you retrieve the Draconian Madstone for me, I'll be happy to compensate you by rewarding you with another Akaviri artifact. Are you in the game? Let me tell you how you're going to find the talisman. I've come into the possession of a diary written by an Akaviri messenger. I suspect that the text within can lead you to the ruins. Here's a translation of the passages we could still read. It was quite damaged. I've also included a rough map that was drawn in the diary as well. I'm also providing you with a unique key that was supposedly found with the diary. I'm assuming it will prove useful when you arrive at the site.

I believed he was chosen by the gods to reclaim the Relics. At first things were going well. He prayed at all the shrines, and received a vision. A disturbing vision. "The shade of Sir Berich spoke to me," was all he said. "We must put him to rest." He said that Sir Berich's tomb was in Underpall Cave -- which is no cave, but some kind of buried keep. He had learned that Sir Berich had once been a questing knight, like us. He had found the Greaves and Sword of the Crusader, but then turned to evil. Sir Roderic hoped to find the Relics within Sir Berich's tomb. And he did. But we also found a terrible guardian -- the wraith of Sir Berich. I brought you... Sir Roderic shouted for me to take them... the Greaves of the Crusader. The holy Relic. They're yours. The wraith used the Sword of the Crusader against Sir Roderic.

Well, don't laugh... it's a bunch of damn fish. I'm a fisherman. Or at least, I was. Until one of those slaughterfish damn near took my leg off. I was collecting their scales, see. I had a contract with this young alchemist. You wouldn't believe what he was paying for those scales! Then last month, one of the bastards got ahold of my leg. Took me right out of the business. But this alchemist, he needs the scales right away. The alchemist was paying so much for the scales that I'm close to having enough saved so that I can retire. But now, I can't get out there to Lake Rumare -- not with this leg. I only needed twelve more scales! Can you believe it? I was so close! I've picked up a few things in my travels. If you head out there and bring me back the twelve scales that I need, I can make it worth your time. Help an old fisherman out, won't you?

### Objective: help Modryn Oreyn prove that the Blackwood Company lied about completing a contract for Argoth
### First Tasks: meet up with Modryn Oreyn, investigate Arpenia with Modryn Oreyn
### First Task Locations:  - Leyawiin guild hall, Arpenia - Azani Blackheart's stronghold
### Quest Giver: NONE - NONE (location: NONE)
### Reward: NONE -  (amount: 1)
### Characters: Azani Blackheart - a ruthless male bandit leader (location: ), Argoth - a male wizard (location: ), Vitellus Donton - a fellow member of the Fighters Guild, a man (location: ), Vilena Donton - the female guildmaster of the Fighters Guild (location: )
### Tools: Modryn Oreyn has been investigating the Blackwood Company: they are a danger to the Fighters Guild, the Fighters Guild was contracted by Argoth to recover an artifact from Azani Blackheart: Modryn Oreyn went in there with twenty good men, and left with five, Vitellus Donton was not one of the survivors: he died while covering the Fighters Guild members' retreat, Argoth is dead and the artifact is gone after the Blackwood Company supposedly finished the contract instead of the Fighters Guild, Vilena Donton is not going to know about this mission: it's the player's choice to accept the mission
### Description: Good. You're here. We've got duties to attend to. I've been looking into the Blackwood Company. Heard some disturbing things. We know they're a danger to us. And we know they're good at what they do. I've heard stories, but nothing I can prove is true. Maybe they've got a mage working with them. Maybe they're just well trained. All I know for sure is that they'll accept any contract, and they'll do anything to complete it. And they don't care who gets in the way. We were contracted by a wizard, Argoth, to recover an artifact from Azani Blackheart, a ruthless bandit leader. I went in there with twenty men. I left with five. Vitellus Donton wasn't one of them. He died covering our retreat. I snooped around. Apparently, the Blackwood Company completed that contract for us. I went in there with twenty good men. I can't believe that bunch finished the job. There's more. Argoth -- he's dead, the artifact gone. Sounds like a set-up. Maybe they made a deal with Blackheart. I don't know. But I'll find out. Now we find out what really happened. And we let it be known. I want to show the people who the Blackwood Company really are. I can't order you do this with me. It's dangerous, and Vilena Donton isn't going to know about it. It's your choice. If you accept this mission, we leave as soon as you're ready. I want to investigate Blackheart's stronghold at Arpenia. Meet me at the Leyawiin guild hall. We'll go from there.

### Description: Now I ask for a more specific task that will disrupt the Shadow Thieves further. The task is... unseemly. It calls for the murder of a man. Not a truly innocent man, but hardly a villain of epic scope. You must kill, blaming the murder on the Shadow Thieves. He is head of a merchant house, and his link to Shadow Thieves is blatant. If he were to die and certain gear were at the scene, it would implicate the guild we oppose. Take this cloak and dagger, and go kill Senior Armagaran Vulova. When he is dead, put the cloak and dagger in the fountain in his house. He will die easily, though there may be guards. His small house is in the Government District, between the jail and the government building. Go.

### Description: Have you heard the story of how we came to be werewolves? The Companions are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of beastblood has only troubled us for a few hundred. One of my predecessors was a good, but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with the witches of Glenmoril Coven. If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord, Hircine, we would be granted great power. The Companions of old became werewolves. They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else. But we had been deceived. The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit. Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds. For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity. And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home. I've spent my twilight years trying to find a cure myself. And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us. They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force. I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild. And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity.

### First Task Locations:  - a shrine to Saint Kaladas, below the Chapel of Zenithar in Leyawiin
### Quest Giver: NONE - NONE (location: NONE)
### Reward: Mace of Zenithar - a holy mace (amount: 1)
### Characters: Zenithar - the god of work and commerce, one of the Nine (location: ), Saint Kaladas - a long-dead saint (location: )
### Tools: the player has passed the gauntlet unlike others in three hundred years: the player can redeem the souls of the ghost knights and restore their order, Sir Ralvas placed his own will and lust for fame over the will of the Nine, Sir Ralvas failed the challenge of Zenithar: the inscription for the challenge says to "walk in the faith", the player must pray at the shrine of Saint Kaladas to receive a vision: the player will see the Mace of Zenithar, separated from them by a great chasm, Sir Ralvas fell from the platform each time he tried to cross the chasm
### Description: You have my, Sir Ralvas', tribute, sir knight. In three hundred years, none have passed the gauntlet. In three hundred years, we have never known hope. But for the first time, it seems that someone may succeed where we have failed. I see in you the chance to redeem our souls and restore the order. And now, I must ask you to press forward where I could not. I must ask you to face the challenge of Zenithar. I was arrogant and foolhardy. I sought personal glory. I placed my own will and my own lust for fame over the will of the Nine. In facing the challenge of Zenithar, I failed. I tried dozens -- no, hundreds of times to reach the Mace. I fell each time. And each time I awoke in the chapel, I leaped again. I tried to enlist the help of the other knights, but none would come to my aid. The inscription says to "walk in the faith" but even now, I do not know what this means. Below the Chapel of Zenithar in Leyawiin there is a shrine to the great craftsman, Saint Kaladas. Those seeking the Mace must pray before the shrine. When you bow, you will receive a vision -- or perhaps not. It is unclear. The priests saw that my body never moved, but it felt so real. You will see the Mace of Zenithar, separated from you by a great chasm. The chasm represents your doubt. Your faith must be your guide across it. This is what I know. As I said, my faith was weak. I did not understand the test and I fell from the platform each time I tried to cross. I have told you all that I know. All that is left is for you to prove yourself more worthy than I. If you seek the Mace, travel to Leyawiin's chapel, kneel at the shrine in the undercroft, and let your faith in the Nine be the salvation of us all.

### Quest Name: Forbidden Legend

### First Task Locations: Folgunthur - the ancient barrows at the foot of Solitude, Saarthal - ancient, shattered, half-buried crypts, Geirmund's Hall - a tomb
### Quest Giver: NONE - NONE (location: NONE)
### Reward: Gauldur Amulet - a powerful amulet that belonged to Archmage Gauldur (amount: 1)
### Characters: Archmage Gauldur - a man revered throughout the north for his wisdom, wealth, honor, and power, who lived during the first era (location: ), Mikrul - the youngest of Archmage Gauldur's three sons (location: ), Jyrik - the oldest of Archmage Gauldur's three sons (location: ), Sigdis - the middle child of Archmage Gauldur's three sons (location: ), Archmage Geirmund - a tough male wizard (location: )
### Tools: the Gauldur name wiped out from the annals of history, Mikrul, Jyrik, and Sigdis lusted after Archmage Gauldur's power and prestige: they discovered Archmage Gauldur's source of power, the Gauldur Amulet, Archmage Gauldur was murdered by his sons Mikrul, Jyrik, and Sigdis: they split the Gauldur Amulet between them, Mikrul, Jyrik, and Sigdis laid waste to surrounding villages: the high king sent Archmage Geirmund and his battlemages after Mikrul, Jyrik, and Sigdis
### Description: Daynas Valen's Notes by Daynas Valen  How to summarize a lifetime of research? So little of what I have learned matters now - the petty politics of ancient times, the age-long campaign to wipe out all mention of the Gauldur name. In the opening days of the First Era, the Archmage Gauldur was revered throughout the north. Wisdom, wealth, honor, and power were his, and even the legendary heros' heirs sought his counsel. Smothered by his shadow, Gauldur's three sons grew cruel and resentful. They lusted after their father's power and prestige, and eventually Jyrik, the eldest, discovered its source: a mysterious amulet, from which he never parted. Together, they conspired to murder their father in his sleep and divide his amulet between them. And so it was done. Consumed by their newfound power, the brothers laid waste to the surrounding villages. So great was the carnage that the High King himself intervened, sending a company of battlemages led by the Archmage Geirmund to subdue the brothers. And after a devastating battle, the three fled the field. Mikrul, the youngest, was run to ground in Folgunthur, the ancient barrows at the foot of Solitude. Geirmund pursued Jyrik to the shattered crypts of Saarthal, half-buried even then. And at last, Sigdis was cornered in the southernmost reaches of land and later entombed in Geirmund's Hall.

### Description: Greetings. I'm Nerussa. I'm quite fond of collecting all manners of wines from all over Tamriel. But one vintage continues to elude me: Shadowbanish Wine. How I'd love to add it to my collection. Apparently the wine is so rare because it was only made in one tiny batch. It's the product of an alchemist who was also a vintner. Besides tasting incredible, the magic within the wine allows the imbiber to be gifted with Night Eye! The vintner made it special for the Legion soldiers posted at the forts when they were active long ago. It was perfect for keeping lookouts warm on cold nights and helping them see better in the dark. If you can retrieve six bottles of Shadowbanish Wine, I'll gladly pay you well: 1,000 gold. All I know about them is that they're found in the many fort ruins scattered all over Cyrodiil.

### Description: I've been working on something. An improvement on the Ebonyflesh spell. I've made progress, but then hit a snag. I think perhaps you could help. I made some progress using the essence of dragon scales. But they're just not quite potent enough. My knowledge of history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things. First, there are ancient references to dragon "heartscales". What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need. Second, there are stories of a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang, said to be sharp enough to carve heartscales off a dragon. First you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few heartscales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one. If my research succeeds, I certainly think you deserve the first copy of the Dragonhide spell tome.

### Tools: Teinaava needs help with a personal matter, just as a member of the Dark Brotherhood cannot kill a fellow family member, a Shadowscale is forbidden from slaying another Shadowscale

Kill this renegade. and bring me his heart as proof of the deed. I have some history with Scar-Tail. When Ocheeva and I trained with the Dark Brotherhood as children, we befriended another initiate, a Shadowscale by the name of Scar-Tail. The three of us were inseparable. When our training was completed, we reluctantly parted ways. But now... Now, the unthinkable has happened! Scar-Tail has fled Black Marsh and refuses to fulfill his duties as royal assassin! This is an act of treason! This treachery must be punished! Just as a member of the Dark Brotherhood cannot kill a fellow family member, a Shadowscale is forbidden from slaying another Shadowscale. That is why you must go to Bogwater and eliminate that treacherous snake! Please kill Scar-Tail, so Ocheeva and I can put this matter behind us.

In my darkest times, I fear he fell in among the werebears of the glacier. Werebears are twisted, cursed beasts. True bears are noble and great creatures of the wild. I've heard tell of men who, by curse or by heart's desire, become transformed into one of those vile things. It is a pitiable fate. And one that I fear has fallen to my brother. If you happen to cross his path, be wary. He was a fierce warrior as a man. If he fell prey to his more bestial side, he could be deadly.

### Description: Here's the deal. Jorundr and I have had a rocky relationship at best. Against my will, I've been dragged all over Cyrodiil helping him commit petty crimes. I wouldn't say we're thieves. I mean, we've stolen things... sure. But we've never stolen that much at one time. Just enough to keep us going. That is, until last year. Jorundr started to take risks and began robbing more dangerous targets. Not just lone merchants, mind you. I'm talking about the bigger scores. Like estates and tax shipments. I begged him to stop, as I knew that his capers would one day lead to violence. He just threatened to... hurt me if I got in his way. I think the gold changed him. I really do. He wasn't the man I met seven years ago. The few times I tried to say something, he'd strike me or push me away. I began to become frightened of him. Our last score was a tax shipment being delivered to the Imperial City. We robbed it, and in the midst of the chaos, Jorundr killed a guard. I was mortified. We snatched up the gold and holed up in the mountains. He said if I breathed a word of the murder to anyone, he'd kill me. I was terrified of him at this point. Two days later, the Bruma City Guard traced us to our makeshift campsite. I was off gathering food, but Jorundr was captured. Served him right. When I went back to the site later, the gold was gone! He'd moved it! What I need you to do is go to the Bruma Castle Dungeons and speak to him for me. Convince him to tell you where the gold is and then we split it.
