### Response:
This one moves! A welcome change. So, mortal, you have found my shrine, and you have seen my followers. They are an embarrassment to me, Peryite. The fools cast a spell in the hopes of summoning me to them. It was prideful and foolish, and it has had its consequences. My followers are trapped between worlds; their bodies here on this plane, their souls in Oblivion. I would have you reunite the bodies and the souls. I will transport you to the plane of Oblivion in which they are trapped. Find their souls. When all are collected, I will return you here. You shall have Spell Breaker, with my blessing. May it bring you order.
