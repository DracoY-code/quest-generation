Sigh. I've got my hands full here. Between the farm chores, cultivating my supply of Nirnroot and keeping a tight rein on my sister Aduri, there's little time for rest. Could you help me? One of the ingredients I need to cultivate Nirnroot are Jazbay Grapes... the acidic content of the juice is perfect for the soil. I need twenty of them for my current crop. I'll give you something for your efforts... finding all of them might not be easy... or cheap.
