### Response:
I am Officer Vai of the Flaming Fist and, to be honest, I could use your help. The bandit raids have been getting worse. I used to think that they were just your usual brigands out to make a quick buck in troubled times, but not anymore. They're working for someone... Damn it, this is a fine mess, isn't it? I'll pay 50 gold pieces for every bandit scalp you can bring me â€” and spread the news. I want this whole region cleared, and I want to know what in the Nine Hells is going on here.
