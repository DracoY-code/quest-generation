### Response:
Leave, stranger. Evil stirs in this place. I fear for the security of the very land if it should break free. We stand at the tomb of Hevnoraak, who has been dead for many generations. I fear, however, that his return may be at hand. I have been holding him here. While he regains strength, however, I am fading. By now I can barely contain his power, much less defeat him if he awakens. But with the help of a living champion I may be able to succeed. Three vessels in the tomb below hold the power to vanquish Hevnoraak. Before anything else, we need those. Bring them to me - but be careful, mortal. They are guarded by Hevnoraak's minions. They will stop at nothing to see their master return.
