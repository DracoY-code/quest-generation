### Description: Mighty bold of you, asking for smithing training. What makes you think you're worth my time? I bet you don't know the first thing about smithing. Have you read up on the history of the craft? I doubt it. You answer a simple question, and I'll think about training you. So here it is: What does the name Hazadir mean to you? Few recognize the name anymore, even though he was famous. Had a book written about him, in fact! I don't have a copy myself, but there was one in First Edition last time I was browsing there. At least some people take an interest in history.
