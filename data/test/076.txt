### Response:
Good. You're here. We've got duties to attend to. I've been looking into the Blackwood Company. Heard some disturbing things. We know they're a danger to us. And we know they're good at what they do. I've heard stories, but nothing I can prove is true. Maybe they've got a mage working with them. Maybe they're just well trained. All I know for sure is that they'll accept any contract, and they'll do anything to complete it. And they don't care who gets in the way. We were contracted by a wizard, Argoth, to recover an artifact from Azani Blackheart, a ruthless bandit leader. I went in there with twenty men. I left with five. Vitellus Donton wasn't one of them. He died covering our retreat. I snooped around. Apparently, the Blackwood Company completed that contract for us. I went in there with twenty good men. I can't believe that bunch finished the job. There's more. Argoth -- he's dead, the artifact gone. Sounds like a set-up. Maybe they made a deal with Blackheart. I don't know. But I'll find out. Now we find out what really happened. And we let it be known. I want to show the people who the Blackwood Company really are. I can't order you do this with me. It's dangerous, and Vilena Donton isn't going to know about it. It's your choice. If you accept this mission, we leave as soon as you're ready. I want to investigate Blackheart's stronghold at Arpenia. Meet me at the Leyawiin guild hall. We'll go from there.
