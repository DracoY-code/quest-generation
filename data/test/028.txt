### Response:
It's Talon Yarryl, priest of Talos. I have a chore for you that may prove interesting. This is not a matter of negotiation or exploration. No, now you are to face true enemies of Talos. Slanderous words have been said. Things did not go well for Stormherald Nallabir at this past tenday's theological debate in the Government District. The growing arrogance of the Lathanderian church is distasteful. Talos should be feared; their irreverence is insulting. We have hired a thief, and he has stolen a Dawn Ring from the Lathanderian temple. Find Travin in the slums at night, collect the ring, and return it here. Remember that the honor of Talos rests upon your shoulders.
