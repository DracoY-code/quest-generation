I keep the villagers fed. Without my crops, our village would surely face a famine! Sometimes, I like to cook new foods using various natural ingredients to prepare us for poor harvests. This time, I tried to make some mushroom stew, but one of the villagers accidentally tripped, and dropped some flowers into the pot with the stew. Traveler, could you please taste the suspicious mushroom stew? It can have either positive or negative effects on its eater. I'm giving you some. Please see what happens after eating the suspicious stew, and report back to me. I'd hate to throw away the whole batch of mushroom stew for nothing. I'll even give you 10 emeralds for being a taster.
