### Response:
I've been pouring over some of the tomes left here in the keep. Interesting stories, indeed. Seems the previous incarnation of the Dawnguard had, at one time, some interesting toys. I have located one of their toys. Arkay and I think it could be a great advantage for us. You should look into retrieving it. It is a magical shield that when blocked with, surrounds its wielder with a holy aura that harms the undead. Might come in handy. You'll be up against the Falmer of Sightless Pit, if I understand Arkay correctly. Nothing you can't handle.
