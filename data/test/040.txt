### Response:
I write drama, friend. The legends and history of the world made to excite and inspire. Poor Giruad Gemane at the Bards College has been waiting for my latest work, "Olaf and the Dragon," for weeks now. Roads are a mess. You'll deliver the book for me? You're sure? When you see Giruad, ask for a tip. I'm sure he'll be in a good mood after reading this.
