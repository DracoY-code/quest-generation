### Description: I think I saw an Illager scout keeping an eye on our village from the shadows of nearby trees. Pineville is not safe! The Illagers of the Dark Hall are going to kill us all! Traveler, could you please help me calm my nerves? It is said that there is a woodland mansion called the Dark Hall deep in the thickets of Darkwood. It is supposed to be a safe haven for Illagers, those bloodthirsty outcasts who resorted to banditry! I would like you to scout out Darkwood. Be cautious. Darkwood is a dark, dense forest with thick leaf canopies that block sunlight: perfect for ambushes. Find out if the Dark Hall truly exists. I'll pay you a block of emerald! Those are not that easy to come by!
