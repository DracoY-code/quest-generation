### Description: I need to finish my research on dragons. While you're out hunting dragons, keep a sharp eye open for any dragon scales and bones you might find. I'd be interested in looking at them. Have you ever heard of the expression, "the scale of the lizard that bit you?" No, I guess not. Well, the principle applies here. I'll make you a potion, made from those dragon parts.
