### Response:
Hmmn. I don't remember seeing you down here before. Me name be Roger. Oh, the sewers aren't so terrible. The guards don't be comin' down here, and my customers like to be somewhere... out of sight. 'Tis the beasties that are the biggest problem, especially of late. There's this sea troll. People have 'em as pets, and when they grow too large, they huck 'em down here to torment me. I suppose I could part with a few coins for the deed. I tell you what... dispose of the sea troll beastie for me, an' I'll be pleased to pay you 500 gold pieces, aye?
