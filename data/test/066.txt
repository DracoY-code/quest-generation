Marius Caro, by grace of the Gods, Count of Leyawiin. You are a stranger to me, but well-met. Perhaps you would like to do a service for Leyawiin? I need your help. An Orc named Mazoga here claims to be a knight, but will not reveal her business. Find out why she is here, and report to me, and you will earn a reward suitable for those who serve Leyawiin.
