### Description: Greetings, my friend! Welcome to Zeryphesh! I am Malik Vosh. I speak for the Zeraphi. As you know, the Ezrohir are preparing to assault our city. Our military leader, Commander Muzaffar, has apparently been captured by the Ezrohir, out in the Ossean Wastes. They'll have sent for soldiers to take their prisoners back to their stronghold. Once they get him to Riftkeep, they'll identify him quickly enough, and then they'll interrogate him until they know everything about our defenses. I believe you're going out to the Ossean Wastes, the vast desert. Please, rescue Muzaffar. We need him.
