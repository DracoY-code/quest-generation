### Description: I raise my face from my maps for a moment, and there you are! Just as I need the help of a trusted friend. There are many, many regions in this world: mapping them all out is a tremendous task. I ask you to map out one of them: Spruced Hills. It is a taiga hills region, which means that there might be some rather steep hills covered in spruces and snow. After making a map of Spruced Hills, come back here and give the map to me. I shall give you a spyglass, a fine tool for an aspiring cartographer. Travel safely! Being mindful of your surroundings is an important skill for everyone, not just us cartographers.
