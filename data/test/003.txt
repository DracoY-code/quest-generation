Hello there, I'm Taerom Fuiruim, a blacksmith of some renown. An interesting piece o' material you got there. Ankheg, if I'm not mistaken. Been a while since I seen the like, but if I remember correctly, it makes a fine set of armor. If properly treated it's comparable to full plate with half the weight! If you're willing to part with your shells I'll give you 500 gold for the lot of them. No more can I offer with business as slow as it is. Iron shortage hurting us all.
