I'm Shum gro-Yarug, the Count's butler. So you want to buy a house? I can speak for the Count. Rosethorn Hall is a stately manor currently occupied by Vandorallen Trebatius. You won't find a better property for sale in Skingrad. It's just inside the main gate, near the bridge to the chapel. The house costs 25,000 septims. Give me the septims, and I will order the deed to the house drawn up. Don't worry about Vandorallen Trebatius. I'll have him evicted. I'm sure he'll find another home easily.
