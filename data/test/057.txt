I am Gaal, high priest of the One God. There is... something that you could do that the great one cannot, despite his vast power. The Unseeing Eye knows of a valuable item in this area. The item is a rod... or part of a rod, rather, that you will find atop a holy altar. I cannot tell you more than that. You must let your faith guide you. If you were to venture below, you could prove your worth by retrieving this artifact for him. Do this, and I will allow you into our ranks and the One's divine presence. I have a key I can give you... This will allow you entrance to the inner chambers through a door a short distance back the way you came, at the sewer passages.
