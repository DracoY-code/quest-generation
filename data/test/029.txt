Hey, I'm Zhurlong! What is a thief to do, huh? You invest in some Boots of Stealth, you set up shop in the badlands to the south of Beregost and then, WHAM... Along comes a tribe of hobgoblins and they tear the boots from right off your feet! Damn-blasted hobgoblin bullies... I'll pay you 100 gold pieces to show them who's boss and get those boots back...
