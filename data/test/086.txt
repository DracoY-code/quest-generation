Looking for more work, eh? Good. I have got a contract for you. I'd like you to go talk to Norbert Lelles, here in Anvil. He runs Quality Merchandise here in Anvil. He's been having problems with break-ins, though, and he's hired us to put a stop to it. Sounds like he wants your help stopping the theft at his store. Take care of Lelles. He needs the help.
