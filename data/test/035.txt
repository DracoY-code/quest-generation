### Description: Bryling's already come down hard on us for missing shipments. Likely to do it again, since we're late. You could take word to her in Solitude that there'll be a shipment soon. Buy us some time and keep her off our backs. In exchange, I'm willing to let a few ingots go missing. Maybe more than a few. You'd do me quite a favor. I wouldn't forget it. I'm sure she'll be angry. Brace yourself.
