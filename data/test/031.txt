You want through THIS door? Ha! Well, it's not as simple as that. Everything has a price - you must know that by now. If you can solve a problem for us, we will solve a problem for you by letting you through the door. Thiss, the great Spectral Dragon, has kept something of ours for many long years. We would like it back - and you will get it for us, oh yes. There is a Crown, a... family heirloom that he stole from us. He will not give it up easily, of course. But this door is im-PENETRABLE - so you've got a much better chance with Thiss than you do waiting around here. You can find Thiss in the Forgotten Halls... good luck! You're going to need it.
