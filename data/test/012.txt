I'm afraid I haven't had time to prepare anything conventional for your recommendation. I'm very preoccupied with this situation concerning Ardaline. Perhaps you can help with that, however. I can't directly get involved, for fear of embarrassing the poor girl. Varon Vamori's been bothering Ardaline every day for a while now. He even stole her Mages' Staff! Perhaps he thinks it's amusing; I don't know. But it needs to stop. It's making her miserable. I'll need you to have a little chat with Varon Vamori to get Ardaline's staff back, and you can learn something about the power of Illusion in the process. Take this charm scroll. With it, you should find Varon more receptive to questioning. Don't come back without that staff. I'll write you a recommendation for your help.
