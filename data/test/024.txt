A few days ago, some thieves from Riften broke in here and stole it! Can you imagine? Took the only thing of value we had. It was a family heirloom. I can't even put a price on how much that thing means to me. I'm sure that they are from Riften. I bumped into them when I was coming back to my farm after buying supplies. I know those lowlifes took it with them back to the Ratway. They left an unmistakable stench behind. If you have the guts to head into the Ratway and get my bow back, I'll pay you what I can. It would be nice to have it back... means a lot to me.
