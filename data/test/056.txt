Sir knight! I have terrible news. Sir Roderic... I think he's dead. Sir Roderic was a holy knight, like you, questing for the Relics at the Prophet's call. I, Lathon, was his squire. I believed he was chosen by the gods to reclaim the Relics. At first things were going well. He prayed at all the shrines, and received a vision. A disturbing vision. "The shade of Sir Berich spoke to me," was all he said. "We must put him to rest." He said that Sir Berich's tomb was in Underpall Cave -- which is no cave, but some kind of buried keep. He had learned that Sir Berich had once been a questing knight, like us. He had found the Greaves and Sword of the Crusader, but then turned to evil. Sir Roderic hoped to find the Relics within Sir Berich's tomb. And he did. But we also found a terrible guardian -- the wraith of Sir Berich. I brought you... Sir Roderic shouted for me to take them... the Greaves of the Crusader. The holy Relic. They're yours. The wraith used the Sword of the Crusader against Sir Roderic. I don't know how that evil thing could use the holy weapon, but it did. You must avenge Sir Roderic by killing the foul wraith and get yourself the Sword of the Crusader!
