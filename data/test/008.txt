### Description: Oh, it's you. I didn't expect to see you again. I'm trying to stay alive. I think time's running out though. I'm pretty sure the Thalmor know where I am. Maybe you can help me. I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere, that is. But there's a Khajiit hanging around the main gate. I didn't like the way he was looking at me. I'm sure he's Thalmor. Just waiting for me to leave Windhelm so he can follow me and kill me in a lonely place. You'd be saving my life. Again. I know I probably seemed ungrateful... I've just been so scared. Expecting a knife at my throat any minute.
