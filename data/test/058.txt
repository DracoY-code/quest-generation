Excuse me, I... I do not mean to be rude... but you *are* one of the strangers that all the locals have been talking about, aren't you? An adventurer from the north? Yes, yes, of course you are. Anyone can see that you are an extraordinary person. Please forgive me. I would not bother you, stranger, but I am in terrible peril! I need your aid! I beg you for a boon or I and my daughter both shall surely perish! I... cannot speak more of this here. Please come to my home on top of the cliff, I beg you! We can speak freely there! My home is atop the east cliff, adventurer. It is a simple dwelling but... safe, for the moment. My name is Marlowe... please meet me there and I shall explain everything, I swear.
