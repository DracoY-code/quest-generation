### Response:
Training? Oh, I'm afraid that's not my area of expertise. I'm very focused on wines right now, you see. Wonderful thing, wine. It's all about the balance. The flavor, the bouquet, the consistency... just wonderful. I'm sorry, what? Training... right. I'll make you a deal: you fetch me a bottle of each of the best wines from Skingrad, and I'll think about it. Both vineyards, Tamika's and Surilie Brothers. Vintage 399. Oh, what a good year that was...
