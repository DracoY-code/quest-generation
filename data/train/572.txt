I do nothing around here. And I hope to keep it that way. The Jarl is convinced I have some connection with the College, so he goes easy on me. Maybe you'd like to help me keep up appearances? Old Nelacar has a mage's staff in his room in the Frozen Hearth. It'd be good to have that staff in case the Jarl starts wondering if I actually have a real connection to the College. Pinch that staff for me. I'll be waiting for it. Once I have it, I'll show you a few tricks I've learned about buttering up royalty.
