### Response:
I'm Lami, an alchemist. I picked up the alchemy trade when I was a girl. One of the temple healers staying here on a pilgrimage showed me the basics. She had a book with her, "Song of the Alchemists", that I used to read over and over. I miss having a copy. Could you find that book for me? I'd be happy to show you a bit about herbs if you find the book.
