River's End is a large village, yet we lack a watchhouse! We don't have a place to store away all troublemakers! They are free to roam along the law-abiding people... Hero, you are an honorable person. Could you build us a watchhouse? You should gather up some construction materials first. Complete the watchhouse, and we'll give you an enchanted axe. May it help you bury your enemies!
