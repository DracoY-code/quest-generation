I've been told that there are sheep in all possible colors; not just black, gray, white and brown. I'm not the sharpest shepherd around. You seem like a clever person: perhaps you know how to find these colorful sheep. Sheep love grass; they tend to stay in grassy areas. Let me have some colorful, beautiful sheep. I want to test breeding a flock of sheep in all colors of the rainbow. I'll let you have a pile of regular ole white wool.
