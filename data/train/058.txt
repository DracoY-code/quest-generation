A nasty person like you can go to the Nether. No one would miss you, if you were to die in there. If you don't burn yourself in lava, you could do a bit something for me there. I have heard that there's a new kind of metal that can be fashioned into a sword that cuts sharper than diamond! I can't wait to experiment on that metal: it's called Netherite, and it can be refined from a rare ore known only as "Ancient Debris". Mine 8 Ancient Debris, and bring them to me. I'll even fashion you a new kind of sword for your help. Only use it on monsters: you'll just dull its blade for nothing by sticking it into innocent villagers.
