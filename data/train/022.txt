<|begin_description|>
That cat beggar Bhisha the Khajiit is following me! He's going to eat me, I just know it. Don't look! He's standing right over there. You haven't seen that filthy cat beggar have you? He's still around. I've seen him skulking like the filthy cat he is. Isn't he scary? I wish someone would just make him disappear. I would do just about anything for you if you make him go away. Permanently. For good. Never to be seen again. You need a dog. I happen to have one of my old ones still lying around. I'll send it to you after you get rid of the filthy cat man.
