You're going to go kill a Dawnguard spy. But don't draw attention. Some kills are for fun, some for profit. And others are for sending messages. This one is a message. Don't make a big scene. Don't get caught. The corpse is to be the message, not the attack. With any luck he'll bleed to death before anyone notices. A cold corpse will say what we want better than a warm one.
