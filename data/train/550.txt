### Description: You seem far too nice to be one of Ulrich Leland's men. What can I do for you? Don't even get me started about Ulrich. That madman won't be satisfied until everyone in town is dead broke...or in jail! What in Oblivion is Ulrich doing with all that money anyway? I'm sure he's lining his pockets with the gold of the good citizens of Cheydinhal. There's only one man who seems to care: Garrus Darelliun, the second-in-command of the guard. I hear he isn't happy with Ulrich. I don't know what you can do for us in this situation. I mean, Ulrich Leland is the Captain after all. Perhaps you could speak to Garrus. You can find him roaming the County Hall of the castle most of the time.
