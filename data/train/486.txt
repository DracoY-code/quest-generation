You are a friend of us villagers, and have helped many of us. Now I'd like you to do something a bit... less conventional. Illagers have been bothering us for ages: we villagers are not fighters; we can't hold our own against those bloodthirsty brigands. I want you to sow distrust among their ranks: make them fight amongst themselves. I already have a plan for you to follow. There are two Illager captains, Tony and Tom, who do not exactly see eye to eye. You should go to the Illager camp to the northeast, and pinch Tony's axe without being seen. Then, move on to the Illager outpost to the north of here, kill Tom, and plant Tony's axe on Tom's body. Tony is known to be quick to anger: Tom's men will go after him, for they will assume that Tony killed their leader. Do this grueling task, and I'll have something highly valuable for you.
