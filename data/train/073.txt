Welcome to the family, kid. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me. This is how you get your cut of the spoils. Do as you're told and keep your blade clean. We can't turn a profit by killing. You should talk with Delvin Mallory and Vex. They know their way around this place and they'll be able to kick some extra jobs your way. Oh, and talk to Tonilia in the Flagon... she'll set you up with your new armor.
