### Response:
We've gotten a letter about Erikur needing some muscle up in Solitude. I don't know what the fight is about, and that's not our business anyway. I just need you to go out there, look tough, and scare this milk drinker Erikur into submission. No more than that. I don't want to hear about a killing, understand? Go. Bring honor to yourself, and the Companions.
