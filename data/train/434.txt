<|begin_description|>
So... you come seeking the wealth of Grom? My spoils are vast, and have no peer in this realm. There is no path to success for you, lest you survive my arena and prove your worth. Be forewarned - many have tested their mettle on this bloodstained floor, but none have yet succeeded. Their souls are now mine, and they do as they are bid. Will you attempt the challenge? I will await your decision. None have yet triumphed within the walls of my arena. Perhaps you will be the first? Perhaps...
