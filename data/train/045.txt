### Description: I am most certainly not going to sing your praises, you nasty cretin. On the contrary, it would be music to my ears if you helped me reach my musical ambitions. No one in this village seems to care for music, or any of the arts for that matter. For starters, obtain 24 note blocks. It has to be exactly 24, because there are that many different notes to play.
