Get over to Markarth. Rumor has it the Jarl's Steward, Raerek, is a faithful Talos worshiper, if not a true son of Skyrim - he still supports the Empire, after all. But, if confronted with proof of his belief, you might be able to 'persuade' him to aid our cause, indirectly of course. Wouldn't want to sully his reputation, would we? You'll need to be careful with this one. The Jarl's men won't look kindly on you rummaging through the steward's quarters.
