I want all monsters in this world know how much I hate them. Perhaps I could get some of their heads to show my disdain toward them. Zombie heads should show all zombies that I am not to be trifled with. You will certainly help me; many people in this village have told me that you are a resourceful and eager to work. Bring me five zombie heads. Powerful creepers are somehow related to getting the heads, but I don't know how exactly. Get me the heads, and I'll give you wings that let you soar the skies: an Elytra.
