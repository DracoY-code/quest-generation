What? A dragon? In Helgen? That explains what I saw earlier... a dragon flying down from the south... I was hoping I was wrong about what I thought it was... Didn't want to believe my own eyes, is all. The Jarl needs to know if there's a dragon on the loose. Riverwood is defenseless... We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever soldiers he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt.
