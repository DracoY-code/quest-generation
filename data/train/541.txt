### Description: By the gods! I know this looks bad. Let me explain... I called Darklight Tower home, now I know that was a mistake. I am, or was part of a coven serving the Hagravens that live there. So was she. We were supposed to find a sacrifice. Human sacrifice. I told her I couldn't do it and she attacked me. I've done horrible things living here, but never taken an innocent life. I couldn't just find some person for them to kill. We needed a sacrifice for the Initiation. My mother is going to become one of those things, Hagravens. I can't be a part of that. Gods, I can't run away from this. I'm going up there to stop her. This cycle must end. I don't know what brought you here, but I could use your help, if you're willing. Follow me. We have to fight our way up the Tower. I don't think anyone else here is about to have a change of heart.
