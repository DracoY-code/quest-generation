The warmest greetings to you, friend! I hope that you don't mind, but I'm feeling a bit bored right now. I could make myself a game of sorts, if I had six different-colored carpets. You surely wouldn't leave a friend dying in boredom? Please obtain six different-colored carpets, and bring them to me. As a token of our friendship, I'm giving you a pretty painting in return.
