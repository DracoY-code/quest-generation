### Description: I'm Louis Letrush. Looking for work? I need someone to deliver a message to Sibbi Black-Briar. I recently approached Sibbi Black-Briar about buying Frost, one of the finest breeding horses in the realm. He agreed to sell. I paid Sibbi half the cost of Frost up front, but before he could deliver, Maven had him locked up. Sibbi believes this exempts him from our deal. It does not. Head to the Riften Jail and talk to Sibbi. Get him to tell you where Frost and his Lineage Papers are and bring them to me outside Riften. You'll be well paid for your time.
