### Description: So, the Professor sent you after the Power Source? We were on the same mission, but the only way to the Scrapworks is through that pile of rock. I know the Abandoned Sawmill used to have plenty of explosives from when the place was still in operation - a little bit of dynamite would probably get the job done here. I sent my troop after it, but haven't heard a thing. If you can head up there and get that dynamite, we could all pass through and get the Professor what he needs.
