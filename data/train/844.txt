You want to help with my research? Are you willing to be an experimental subject? Oh, it's nothing too dangerous. The experiment should provide an additional spectral tether from your own lifespark to the divine realm. You would experience it as a sort of... increased vigor. You would fight longer, feel stronger, that sort of thing. At least I think it will. Probably. Almost certainly. Of course, you never can tell. Now stand still... it's my first time casting this spell, and I don't need any additional distractions.
