"Sweet waters of the forest flow through each den and glade nourishing the unicorns who lie graceful in the shade..."  I'm Rinnie, a bard and balladeer. I have been working on a ballad about the Unicorn Run in the High Forest. I'd like to use a more reliable source than simply hearsay and folklore, though. If you ever find an authoritative history of the run in your travels, I'd love to get my hands on it. A friend of mine gave me this Scroll of Protection From Poison and I have yet to make use of it, so you could have it as a reward.
