Hey stranger, can you spare a few coins? I've just been shaken down by that bastard watchman and he took my last septim. I don't know his name, but I'd recognize him if I saw him again. Luronk and I were shopping at Jensine's when he accused us of stealing. Even Jensine said we were innocent, but he didn't care. We had to pay his "fine" or go to jail. He's shaken down most of the shopkeepers in the Market District. They're all too afraid of him to do anything. Jensine wouldn't even talk about it. Someone ought to do something about him.
