<|begin_description|>
I see you have served my brethren, and now you come to serve me. I am Hermaeus Mora. Past, present, and future are as one to me. My followers seek to perform a divination. For this, they need souls, one of each of the ten sentient races of Tamriel. You will provide these souls. I give you a spell to trap these souls. Return to me when you have finished. When you do, I will further your journey on your true path. Do your service onto me and I give you this, the Oghma Infinium. Knowledge given by me to Xarxes is recorded within.
