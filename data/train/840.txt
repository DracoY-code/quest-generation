Centuries ago, a djinni named Fazeer Shah and a djinni named Ezrek Khan quarreled over some trivial matter, and ultimately went to war. They caused considerable damage to the cities, and devastated the land, until the Zeraphi sultan had had enough. He banished them both: one to the desert, and one to... another place; a dark realm. If you can reach Fazeer Shah, you might be able to convince him to help us. You must travel out into the Salt Barrens to locate Fazeer Shah.
