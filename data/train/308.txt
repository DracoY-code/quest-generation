This plague seems to specifically target beings of an inherently magical nature, such as the Estherians. So far it's not affecting humans, so I've sent for a transport to bring us some medical supplies, and I'll be coordinating the medical relief here. Meanwhile, you need to get out to the Watchweald Temple. Take Crows' Pass to the Frosted Hills. Try to catch up to the Grand Regent before he enters the temple.
