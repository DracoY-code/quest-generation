I am none other than Jermien... licensed Cowled Wizard for this region. I am working on a golem of stone! A fine piece of magical craftsmanship, if I do say so myself! Few other mages have made the attempt, you see. This type of golem is quite powerful and dangerous... but I am more than skilled enough to control it. Once it's complete, I'll have an excellent servant. Trouble is, I'm missing one of the crucial ingredients... the blood of a mimic. I'd pay handsomely for some, in fact. Hmmm... you look like the adventurous type... care to find me some? Hmm. I seem to recall that I've got a magical sword around here that I won in a bet from a certain fool. I've no use for it, but it's valuable. Find me some mimic's blood and it's yours.
