### Response:
It is time for decisive action. I have one more duty for you to perform. It is clear to me what must be done. The Hist Tree must be destroyed. This tree is the source of our problems. It is an abomination of nature, and it must be destroyed. As long as the Blackwood Company has access to the sap, we are all in danger. I fear they no longer know what they do. You must find a way to destroy the Hist, though I can imagine Ri'Zakar will have it well guarded. He's a warrior, a battle-hardened mercenary who's spent time all over Tamriel. He'll keep his prize tree locked away. You'll need to find his key. Expect an unfriendly welcome at their hall. Finish it.
