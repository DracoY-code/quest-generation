Don't you go anywhere close my crops! Have you not tormented me enough already? Or are you here to reconcile? I could use a new hoe. Perhaps even something somewhat more fancier than my old one. Alright. Bring me a diamond hoe. Then I might forgive you. And I may even give you a small reward on top of that: 32 melons that I grew myself.
