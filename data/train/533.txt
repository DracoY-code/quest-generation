<|begin_description|>
I did the Black Sacrament, over and over. And then you came! An assassin from the Dark Brotherhood! It took so long. So very long. But now that you're here, you can accept my contract. My mother, she... she died. I... I'm all alone now. So they sent me to that terrible orphanage in Riften. Honorhall. The headmistress is an evil, cruel woman. They call her Grelod the Kind. But she's not kind. She's terrible. To all of us. So I ran away, and came home. And performed the Black Sacrament. And you can kill Grelod the Kind! I have a family heirloom you can have. Supposed to be sort of valuable. I hope that's all right.
