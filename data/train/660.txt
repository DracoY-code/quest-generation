<|begin_description|>
You must help me find my Arvak. He doesn't deserve to be in a place like this! Arvak is my horse. We came to this horrible place together. We were attacked by monsters, so I told him to run. Please, he's such a loyal creature, and he's been running for so long. You have to save him! A place like this will change you... If you find him, I'll teach you how to call him to you. I'm sure he'd be much happier someplace sunnier.
