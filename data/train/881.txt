### Response:
Since you helped us in our time of need, we have been searching for a way to return the favor. It seems you've met with some unexpected trouble from Cacklespit the witch. I've done a little research, and if you'd like to find her, I think I can help! From the lore I've been able to piece together, there is a secret way to her hidden realm. The spirit, Fade, can open the way - but he may ask for something in return. You'll have to journey to the Sundered Battlefield in the north. Search for the shrines that mark Fade's resting place. I hope this helps you on your way! I'll keep researching in hopes of finding more information to help you.
