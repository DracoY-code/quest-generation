Ooooh... my patron... We have a real problem. A very large problem. A gigantic problem! One of... one of the council members is here... or, at least, I believe he is one! On opening night! This... this could make or break the playhouse! And Zaren... Zaren is ill! Deathly ill! He cannot even move from his bed! I see only one chance... it's too late for anything else... You must play Velden. You are a bard, naturally gifted... you observed our rehearsals. Please, my patron, I'm begging you! This could be the biggest chance for all of us! And... and we mustn't upset the council member! PLEASE, you must do it!
