### Description: That Moth Priest, Dexion. He said we needed two other Elder Scrolls. I think I know where we can start looking. We need to find my mother, Valerica. She'll definitely know where one of the Scrolls is, and if we're lucky, she actually has it herself. The last time I saw her, she said that she'd go somewhere safe... somewhere that my father would never search. Other than that, she wouldn't tell me anything. But the way she said it... "someplace he would never search." It was cryptic, yet she called attention to it. Wait... There's a courtyard in Castle Volkihar. I used to help her tend a garden there. All of the ingredients for our potions came from there. She used to say that my father couldn't stand the place. Too... peaceful. I don't think we'll actually trip over her there. But it's worth a look.
