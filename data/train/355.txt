I hope you can help. The gate guards have reported seeing strangers on the road for the past several nights. I cannot leave Cloud Ruler undefended while my men search the whole mountainside, but these spies must be eliminated. Talk to Steffan. He can tell you where he has seen them. Captain Burd in Bruma may also be able to help. I've asked the authorities of Bruma to have the guard keep an eye out for strangers. Track down the spies and kill them. Find out what they know, and what they're planning, if possible.
