Greetings, I'm Kagain. I hire mercenaries to escort caravans on route from Amn to Baldur's Gate. Right now I'm lookin' for some strong sword arms, and I'm willing to pay high. It seems that one of the caravans under my protection never arrived at Baldur's Gate, and I need to know what happened. I've been having a lot of problems with bandit activity lately, but they've always only taken the cargo and let the caravan go afterward. I'll pay each of you 30 gold per dead bandit, plus a share of any booty, if there's no one left alive to claim it.
