<|begin_description|>
I am Lothander. I do not wish you harm. My partner, Marek, has poisoned you. While you slept, he slipped a slow-acting magical poison into your food. You have about ten days to live. Common priest spells won't help you. Only one thing can, and that's the antidote. I can help you find it, if you help me first. My problem is this: I don't work for the Iron Throne because I wish to but rather because I have been forced. I have been enspelled with a geas. If I do not obey everything that Marek orders of me the spell will take effect and I shall waste away. I need a way to rid myself of the spell. I know of a diviner at the market square who may have the answers I seek, but I don't have the money to pay him. Will you help me?
