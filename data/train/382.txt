This is an important job. I have a competitor called Honningbrew Meadery that I want to put out of business. I also want to know how they managed to get the place up and running so quickly. Some layabout named Sabjorn runs the Honningbrew Meadery. Been a thorn in my side for the last few years now. With Sabjorn in prison, his meadery will be forced to close. Then I swoop in and take over the place. No more competition. Head to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun and look for Mallus Maccius. He'll fill you in on all the details.
