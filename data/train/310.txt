### Response:
Yes. Hermaeus Mora is devious, but then so am I. Now, it's only a rumor of a whisper of a conjecture. But I think this is the place. Benkongerike. One of the Books is hidden there. Now, hurry and find that Black Book. That Book might contain the final secrets of Xarxes, for all we know. I'll just make a copy for myself. It's far too dangerous to carry the real Black Book around. Of course, I'm sure you can handle yourself. Of course you can. You can keep the original Black Book.
