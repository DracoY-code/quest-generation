### Response:
This store would finally be on its feet if I hadn't lost my last shipment to Forsworn attacks. A specially-made Dibella statuette. You aren't for hire, are you? A sellsword? I'll pay you if you can recover that statuette from the Forsworn at Broken Tower Redoubt. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for you when you return.
