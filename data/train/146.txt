### Description: I don't care if he's a master wizard. He can't treat me like this! Master Neloth, that fetcher, told me to fix his house. If I don't, he'll find a new mycologist who will. Decades of loyal service, and he'd just throw me out like yesterday's breakfast! I need three taproots soaked in the headwaters of the Harstrad river to fix Neloth's tower. I'm an old woman. I can't possibly make that trip. It's way too dangerous. If you get some taproots, I'll pay you to dip them in the headwaters and bring them to me.
