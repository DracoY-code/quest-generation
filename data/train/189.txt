### Response:
My wife has been seeing another man. Sir William of Thorpe... He's a foreign noble establishing trade here in Athkatla. He was a good man â€” at least I always thought so until... until now. My friend, let us bestow some justice. Sir William has challenged my honor. There must be a reprisal. We must make haste to the Mithrest in the Promenade District. I cannot live like this for long.
