### Response:
I want to make my leather works more... dashing and colorful. Bring me 16 cyan dye, and I'll reward you with 32 emeralds. You can make cyan dye by combining green dye with blue dye, I think. I'd obtain the dye myself, but the smell of my tanning chemicals attracts all sorts of unsavory creatures to me out there.
