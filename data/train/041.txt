### Response:
Vinicia Melissaeia, Office of Imperial Commerce. You desire a house in the Imperial City? Why? I mean... of course. All I have available right now is a hovel on the Waterfront. It's yours for mere 2,000 septims. You may give those septims to me. You'll find the house in the Waterfront District. It's not much to look at. You may want to spruce it up a bit with some furnishings. I'd suggest talking to Sergius Verus at Three Brothers Trade Goods in the Market District.
