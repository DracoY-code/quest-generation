### Response:
The entire town is being plagued by horrible nightmares. They're in serious danger but I'm afraid there's little I can do about it. These dreams are manifestations created by Vaermina. She has an awful hunger for our memories. In return, she leaves behind nightmares, not unlike a cough marks a serious illness. I must end her terrible influence over these people before the damage becomes permanent. I need to return to the source of the problem, to Nightcaller Temple. Perhaps you'd be willing to assist me in that regard? I've already said too much. If anyone overhears what we're saying, it could start a panic. I would simply ask that you trust me and help me end Dawnstar's nightmares. Nightcaller Temple is only a short walk from Dawnstar. Come, we must hurry.
