<|begin_description|>
You're going to Fort Neugrad. The Imperials have some of our boys locked up there. But with a little luck, we can turn that to our advantage. I've sent some men to scout out the area. Meet them near Fort Neugrad, see if you can't find a way to slip in the fort, free our men, and take over the fort. They'll never suspect an attack from the inside. This won't be easy. But that's why I'm sending you. You got the grit to get this done?
