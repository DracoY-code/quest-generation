Our village, Woodridge, is stagnating hard! We need more housing so that our village can grow larger. Traveler, do you know anything about building houses? Perhaps you could build a brand new house in our village? You have to gather some house building materials first, though. I have a fine reward for you! A stack of golden carrots. A fine meal after doing some construction work, ain't it?
