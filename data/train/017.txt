### Response:
Welcome to the Bards College. I am Viarmo, the headmaster here. Always a pleasure to meet a prospective bard. You should be aware that many apply but we accept very few people. When possible, we ask applicants to perform tasks the college needs completed. In this case, I do have a task befitting an aspiring bard... Jarl Elisif has forbidden the Burning of King Olaf, a Festival put on by the Bards College. We need to change her mind. To convince her I want to read King Olaf's Verse. A part of the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Unfortunately the poem was lost long ago. According to our histories keeper, the portion of the Edda dealing with King Olaf might still exist in Dead Men's Respite. I need you to retrieve the poem.
