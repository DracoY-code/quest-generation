### Response:
I do have more work for you. A personal matter. My father died trying to negotiate with the Forsworn, back when that was possible. They took his shield to Hag's End, to those Hagraven beasts they consort with. I need you to bring it home where it belongs. I warn you, it's dangerous work. No man of mine has ever faced a Hagraven and lived. I'll understand if you decline. Return my father's shield to me and I'll grant you permission to purchase property in my city. Divines watch over you.
