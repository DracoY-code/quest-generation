### Response:
My work with Savilla's Stone has revealed that I need something special for my plans. It's a small item in the possession of a powerful court wizard. Will you do this for me? I will pay you well. Bring me the Arrow of Extrication. It has a key shaped head. Bravil's court wizard, Fathis Aren, recently acquired this unique item. You may kill Fathis if necessary, but not in the castle. My spy network will tell me when you have it. Return here with the arrow when you do. The beggars in Bravil will surely know where Aren keeps the Arrow. Now we should get out of Malintus' house before we wear out our welcome.
