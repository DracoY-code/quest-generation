### Response:
No one in this village buys the beautiful stones cut by me. I'm a failure of a mason! Friend, could you promote my stoneworks? I really could use more customers. This village is quite large, there ought to be at least a few villagers who might be interested in my stone bricks and other stoneworks. Just hand out some promotional pamphlets to the villagers of Stoneburg. You'll even net a load of emeralds for your services, my friend.
