I'm a fletcher. Bows and arrows are my domain. In fact, I've just crafted a special Bow I've dubbed the "Awesome Bow". I just need someone to test it out. You could be just the right person for the job. Go, and kill 15 Creepers with the Awesome Bow. I friggin' hate those green suicide bombing monsters! I'll have 32 emeralds for you, as a tester's fee.
