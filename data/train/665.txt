You ... you came to rescue us?  Thank the guardians! I've managed to keep Snowbell and Sunbeam safe up here, but I injured my leg. I can't make my way out of this cave while carrying them. If you'll take them to Bellethe, I'll follow you out at my own pace. Tell Bellethe that I'm okay. My thanks to you for your help!
