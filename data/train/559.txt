I have something a little different planned this time. But it's not for everyone to hear. Meet me in the Underforge tonight. Oh yes, you don't yet know where the Underforge is. I forget that you've never seen it. Beneath the Skyforge, where Eorlund works. All I say is that you will receive a gift. A gift that will join your spirit with the beast world, friend. The door to the Underforge is hidden, but I will show you the way.  We will speak more.
