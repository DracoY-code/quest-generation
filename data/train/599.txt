<|begin_description|>
I am Haskill, Chamberlain to the Lord Sheogorath. You approach the Shivering Isles. Through the door behind me lies the realm of Sheogorath, Prince of Madness, Lord of the Never-There. My Lord seeks a mortal to act as His Champion. Perhaps the Lord Sheogorath will find a use for you. You'll want to pass through the Gates of Madness. Oh, and mind the Gatekeeper. He dislikes strangers to the Realm.
