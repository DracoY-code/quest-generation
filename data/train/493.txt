### Response:
I am djinni Malaaq and I have been bound by a wizard to guard his items, and your item it seems. I can sense your touch upon this weapon. If you can secure the means of my release, I will give you your weapon. I was captured in my home, on Plane of Air, by some wizard. He bound me to this flask that I might guard his things. You must find my original flask and bring it back to me. Once it is within my grasp, I can break the enchantment and be freed.
