### Response:
Training? From me? I'm sorry, friend, but I have no idea who you are. Never heard of you. I'm afraid I don't offer training to just anyone. If you were famous, perhaps... or infamous, I suppose... that might count for something. But, alas, you're not. Until I hear your name spoken by others, don't expect any training from me. When you're known as a hero or a villain, I might change my mind.
