### Description: Another girl killed. The victim is Susanna, from Candlehearth Hall. Served me a drink just a few nights ago... but I can't say I knew her. She was killed the same way as the other two girls. Looks like she was stabbed, and then cut apart. It's like an animal got to her, but these are the wounds of a blade. You could help us with the investigation. We're stretched thin as it is with the war. Nobody has the time to spend on this. Not pleasant, but it's the truth. Here are some starting points for you. I noticed a trail of blood leading away from here. Helgird's taken Susanna's body into the Hall of the Dead to prepare for burial. She's a little crazy, but if she knows anything, it's dead bodies.
