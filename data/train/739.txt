I'm scouring for a band of desperate adventurers to aid me in a gallant task. Come and hear Korgan Bloodaxe's tale! A fortnight past, me fellows and I were in the midst of obtaining an ancient text fer our patron when a skirmish visited our midst. Vile words, alas, became a lake of bloodshed. So it goes the sacred grimoire ne'er made it to our benefactor's hand. And now he awaits its arrival with a zeal reserved for a grog-blossom in an alekeg. The scuttlebutt is the pay is handsome and worthy of note â€” sacks of loot and odd magics. The volume sits not far from 'ere, and the bibliomaniac, he paces the floor in the meantime. 'Tis called the Book of Kaza. The Book of Kaza is in some hobnail's tomb over in the lower crypts of the Graveyard District. It's nae abandoned, but rumors and half-truths only scare the young and infirm. Keeps the curious away, me guess. Well... it'll take far more than a few shambling bags of skin and stitches to deter Korgan Bloodaxe from a king's ransom! A foolhardy jaunt into a hive of undead? How could ye resist?
