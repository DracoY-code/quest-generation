### Response:
Jarl Brunwulf Free-Winter is in danger. A vampire plays as a visiting "advisor" to the court of Windhelm. Destroy it before it's able to complete its foul business. But be warned. The Jarl's guards are unaware of the threat, and will treat violence against this "advisor" as a crime. Convince the Jarl of the threat and he'll let you destroy the creature. If not, then do your best not to get caught. Quickly now! The longer you delay, the more danger the Jarl is in.
