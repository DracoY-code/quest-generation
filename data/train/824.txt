My name is Lissa. Something's wrong with my daughter. Her name is Jaella. She's hurt, traveler. I don't know what's wrong with her. She just lies in bed staring at the wall. Won't even eat. Please heal her. She's just a little girl. Please, you must go and find out exactly what Gerhardt knows about Jaella's condition. You'll find him in the basement.
