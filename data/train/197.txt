You're going to Riften. My spies report the Jarl's Steward, Anuriel, has arrangements with the Thieves Guild that would be rather embarrassing if made public. I need you to find evidence of her corrupt activities, and use it to gain a measure of her "cooperation." This will require stealth and discretion. The Jarl's guards won't take kindly to anyone rummaging through the steward's private quarters.
