### Response:
You've proven reliable. There's a group of bandits in my hold that I... may have had a few discreet dealings with. The cut they were giving me was good at first, but now it's time to clean things up. Go to Embershard Mine and take care of them. Teach them to stop paying me. Execute every last bandit. Spare no one.
