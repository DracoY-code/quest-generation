Please forgive my mood. I'm still coming to terms with my daughter's death. Our little girl died recently. I've been shouldering my days with strong mead, but nothing gives my Tova peace. I've been looking for an Amulet of Arkay to remind my wife that our child is with the gods now, but I can't find one. Would you be willing to give me an Amulet of Arkay, should you find one? I hope Arkay grants my wife some comfort.
