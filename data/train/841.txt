### Response:
Mulush is a damn tyrant. Always being goaded on by the Silver-Bloods to get more work out of us. They pay us next to nothing. We get beaten if we make a mistake, and where are our kind Silver-Blood rulers? What are they doing? Typical. You would stick up for us. You're going to try to talk sense into that man? I'll believe it when I see it. It's a week's wages for me, but you've earned every coin if you talk some sense into Mulush.
