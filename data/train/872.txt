I wish you had gotten here sooner! The Alchemist came through here about an hour ago. He laid waste to the camp and then went through the Great Door, there - sealed it shut behind him. We believe that door leads to the Clockwork Core. We've been unable to open it ourselves, but we know how in theory. See that dwarven automaton? It's designed to open the door, but it's missing its Power Source. There should be one in the Scrapworks, but it was too dangerous for us to enter. Perhaps you will have more luck.
