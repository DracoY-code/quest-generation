As the Arch-Mage, you are entitled to certain privileges. In addition to the full use of all Guild facilities, there is one service available to you. Julienne Fanis has long served Arch-Mage Traven in collecting alchemical ingredients for his personal research. As the new Arch-Mage, I'm sure she'll extend the service to you as well. At your convenience, consult her at the Lustratorium.
