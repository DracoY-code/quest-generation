### Description: Good ranger! My name is Mairyn... I am a spirit of this forest, and I am in desperate need of your aid! There are... other humans... in my sacred lands to the north of this place where the temple of the sun god once stood. They have come recently, digging and tearing down the trees... I have begged them to stop, good ranger... I have pleaded with them that they are destroying not only me, but many of the other forest spirits as well. The humans have refused. I implore you... go to the forest in the north and do whatever you can to stop these humans from further desecrating my forest! You must go to them, and seek out the nature of their quest, if you wish. Whatever you do, however, you must stop them. I... I have nothing to offer you, ranger, other than my gratitude. May Mielikki shine on you, good ranger.
