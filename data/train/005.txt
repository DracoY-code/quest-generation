### Response:
The Emperor is still in Skyrim, but not for long. He's onboard his ship, the Katariah, moored offshore in the Solitude inlet. But you must hurry! If you can get onboard that ship. Kill Titus Mede II, as contracted... I will reveal the location of the dead drop that holds your payment. This is the true Emperor, not some half-penny lookalike. He'll be surrounded by elite bodyguards, I'm sure. You'll have your work cut out for you. Still... everyone assumes the Dark Brotherhood has been completely destroyed. They may be a bit more lax than usual.
