It is a pleasure to meet you. I am Countess Valga of Chorrol. Are you looking for a house to buy? There is a positively gorgeous home for sale right on the main plaza. You'll be hard pressed to find a nicer home for sale in Chorrol. The house is called Arborwatch, and it costs 20,000 gold to buy the house from me. It would be a pleasure to have you become a citizen of Chorrol. The last tenant of Arborwatch has cleaned the place of furniture. I'd recommend stopping by Northern Goods and Trade. The owner, Seed-Neeus, should have everything you need.
