<|begin_description|>
We're up against powerful vampires, unlike anything we've seen before. And they have an Elder Scroll. There are people I've met and worked with over the years. We need their skills, their talents, if we're going to survive this. I think we'll want Sorine Jurard. Breton girl, whip-smart and good with tinkering. Fascination with the Dwemer. Weapons in particular. Last I knew, she was out in the Reach, convinced she was about to find the biggest dwarven ruins yet. You'll also want to find Gunmar. Big brute of a Nord, hates vampires almost as much as I do. Got it into his head years back that his experience with animals would help. Trolls in particular, from what I hear. If you can find them, we might have a chance.
