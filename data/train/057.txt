You'd think an apprentice could forge a few hinges. Not Tacitus. I keep showing him how to treat the iron, but he never gets it. In the Legion, the Imperial smiths used to read books when they couldn't set their hammers straight. Wisdom of the old, I guess. If you find a book called 'The Last Scabbard of Akrash', could you bring it to me? Tacitus sure isn't learning by example. Books. Don't know why the Imperials like them so much. It should help the boy, though, Malacath willing. Bring the book, and I'll show you how an Orc learns to smith.
