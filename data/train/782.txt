### Response:
I, Raminus Polus, have a new task for you, and I assure you there are no Necromancers involved. There's a research project going on at Vahtacen, one of the Ayleid ruin sites on the eastern side of the province. Irlav Jarol is in charge of the project, and is apparently in need of some help. I thought you might need a break, after the things you've been exposed to lately. You can find Irlav here in the Arch Mage's Tower.
