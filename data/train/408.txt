Greetings! I am the great bard Trill. You've heard of me of course, my talent is known throughout all of Veras. From Torchlight to Redhaven they sing of my.. songs. Torchlight... did something happen there? I feel a bit... Ah, nevermind. I recognize this place! The spiders called, the Sisters three, the old trunk yawning wide, Through ancient halls, dark ancestry, they met their fates inside. An apt verse, you'll agree. I wrote it myself of course. The rest of the song eludes me... Leniency please! Of course such a lapse is unforgivable in a great bard such as myself, but I feel a bit.. off. Still, even that bare fragment of verse can lead you to glory. Go forth, brave warrior, and slay the mighty beasts! Whatever they may be...
