### Response:
My friend, thank you for coming to our aid. I am Lord Taldimut, the leader of this Zeraphi envoy, sent to procure the Estherians' aid in our upcoming war with the Ezrohir. Grand Regent Eldrayn gave us leave to search the Frosted Hills for the Golden Gear, and we had narrowed our search to these chilly hills before we were assaulted by these goblins. Now we are too injured to continue our search. Can you aid us? The exact location of the Golden Gear is long forgotten, but the Estherians created a map from three crests. If you can find those, I can interpret the map and find the Gear! Search the Frosted Hills for the crests. Bring them to me, and I will reward you, on behalf of the Zeraphi people.
