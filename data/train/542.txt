He even has some wolves guarding it. I swear, I should just cut out his tongue. That would be the end of it. You could get Horgeir's stash for me, but I'll keep my dagger sharpened just in case. You can help yourself to any drink you find, but bring me the bottle of Dragon's Breath Mead. It's his favorite, so I know he has one there.
