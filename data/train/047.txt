My husband Liefnarr said he was going east towards the border of Morrowind to trade some of our grain to some folks at Broken Helm Hollow. I waited and waited, and he never came back. Probably shacked up with some elven whore. Good riddance to him I say. If I only knew where he was, I'd sure give him a piece of my mind. If you see him, tell him Grosta said he can go straight to hell... he's not welcome here any more.
