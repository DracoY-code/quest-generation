### Response:
I've finally derived the location of the White Phial, but my doting busybody of an assistant won't let me get it. It's buried with its maker, Curalmil, in Forsaken Cave, a long forsaken cave to the west of here. Curalmil was a crafty one, even in death. You would need the skills of a master alchemist to reach his resting place. Luckily for you, I've already made the required mixture. Here, take it. Please... don't dally. I've wasted enough time arguing with my useless assistant here.
