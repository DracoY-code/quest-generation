### Response:
Ployer! That... that fat excuse for a slaver, he's cursed me! Damn him! If the curse was tailored to me, it might resist removal by normal means. I doubt Ployer would have done this if the solution were simple. I have a few options. Ployer mentioned that he lived in squalor, suggesting he may be in the poor section of the city. Not likely to find him quick though. The mages with him wore odd colors that might be traceable. Ask at the government building, as all magic is regulated in Athkatla. If they will talk... He also mentioned Belgrade, a merchant that helped expose Ployer. He frequents the Copper Coronet, and the bartender Bernard might know his whereabouts. My very bones ache today. It is as though I age on the inside. Ohh, this cannot go on for long. We must remove this curse!
