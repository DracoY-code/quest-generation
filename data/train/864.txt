### Response:
I'm Irene Metrick. If you needed to know more, you'd already know. How many people have you killed in your lifetime, eh? Not as many as I, my little friend. When we're equals, you might interest me and get some blunt weapons training out of it. If you've killed fifty people, it's still not enough for my tastes, but I might reconsider training you at that point. Leave some bloody trails and tell yourself they all deserved it. Right? Ha, ha.
