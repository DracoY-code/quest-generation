### Description: Can you... can you possibly help J'zargo? You must be very skilled with magic, yes? J'zargo is working hard, but cannot do it alone. J'zargo has worked hard on learning new spells, trying new things. This will make J'zargo stand out as a mage. But J'zargo works so hard, there is no time to test these new spells. If you help with the testing, this will make learning easier. J'zargo will give you scrolls, you will use them and report the results. This is a good plan, no? Let's see... this one, I think. J'zargo has designed it to be an excellent flame cloak, with a twist. It is especially potent against the undead, and should burn them to a crisp in no time. J'zargo gives you plenty of these scrolls, so you try them and return when you can say whether they work.
