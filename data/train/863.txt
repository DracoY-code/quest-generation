You may call me Lady Hannah. Ragefast! Oh, he makes me seethe! He's a mage on a power trip and what does he do? He acquires his own personal nymph and enslaves her in his quarters! Seek him out and look into this matter immediately! His house is in the northwest part of town. I wish you luck and all the passion of my fury in your task.
