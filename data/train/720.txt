Greetings. I am Oisig, cleric of Helm. I would speak with you. I would hire you as a mercenary in the service of Helm. I would prefer a person of faith, but you will be adequate. Follow me to the temple of Helm. I will discuss what is required of you there. Do not take too long; Helm requires you now.
