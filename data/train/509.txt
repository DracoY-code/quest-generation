I have another assassination contract for you: Maluril. He's dangerous. Very dangerous. A rogue Dark Elf mage doing research into dwarven artifacts should be both respected... and feared. Just not by you. Maluril is doing his research in Mzinchaleft. A Dwarven ruin... what an exotic place for a kill. I hope the elf doesn't give you too much trouble. I once got set on fire by a sorcerer. Nasty business, that. But I digress.
