<|end_quest|>
<|begin_description|>
Kidrik the Mauler must have slipped away during the attack, and concealed himself in the underground slave den! And, if the captives are there, as well, Kidrik must be holding them hostage! You must defeat Kidrik and free the captives, or all that has been done to stop the slavers will have been for naught!
