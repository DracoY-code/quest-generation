I'm afraid there's a problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is. He's a dragon. Not just any dragon, but the right hand of Alduin, responsible for many atrocities during the ancient Dragon War. It's true that his crimes are long in the past, but justice does not count the passage of years. Justice demands that he, Paarthurnax, dies for his crimes. Until he is dead, I'm afraid my oath as a Blade prevents me from offering you aid and comfort.
