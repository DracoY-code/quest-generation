A group of mages led by Irlav Jarol took the Bloodworm Helm, and have retreated to Fort Teleman, in an effort to study it further. They hope to learn enough from it to find some sort of way to fight Mannimarco. I tried to dissuade them, but it was no use. I would like the helm to be returned, so that it may be kept safe here in the Arcane University. I fear Irlav has made himself a target for the Necromancers.
