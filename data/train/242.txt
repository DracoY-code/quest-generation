Again, I require your talents. Now to the task at hand. It is time to take down the leadership of the Shadow Thieves and throw them into a more permanent disarray from which they may not recover. You must invade their lair one last time. You must kill Aran Linvail, the Shadowmaster. Do this for me, and our arrangement will be fulfilled. Aran is in the basement of the Shadow Thief guild house, so you need a key. The lock is likely unpickable. What good is a lock in a thieves' guild if any thief can pick it? One more thing: Tizzak, an employee of mine, is missing, and the Thieves may have him. Find him, and he may tell you how to access Aran's sanctum. Go now!
