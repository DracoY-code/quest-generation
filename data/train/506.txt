### Response:
Lord Harkon. Remember your place. Now, he wants the Chalice, then. You've heard of the Bloodstone Chalice? The Chalice has been in Lord Harkon's possession for quite some time now. It is, when used properly, able to increase the potency of our powers. Lord Harkon has neglected using the Chalice for ages. If he wants it filled now, then grander things are afoot. This is good. Follow me. I'll take you to the Bloodstone Chalice.
