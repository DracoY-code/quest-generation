Please, traveler! Wait a moment! I am Jessa - a traveler from Estheria. My father and I came to this place to recover an ancient artifact - the Wraithring - which is said to have power over death itself. We sought to bring it to the Temple for study. My father entered the catacombs while I tended our camp - but he has not returned, and there are dark things stirring below. Please - I only ask that you discover his fate - perhaps he is wounded and only needs aid to escape! If the worst comes to pass... he wears a locket around his neck, and you will know him by it.
