### Response:
I want you to look into Hroggar's house fire. He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze. My people believe the house to be cursed now. Who am I to gainsay them? How the fire started? Hroggar blames his wife for spilling bear fat in the fire. Many folk think he set the fire himself. Lust can make a man do the unthinkable. The ashes were still warm when he pledged himself to to a woman named Alva. I can't arrest Hroggar on rumor and gossip. But you, a stranger, might find the truth for us. Sift through the ashes at Hroggar's house that others are too fearful to touch. See what they tell you. Should you prove him guilty or innocent, I will reward you.
