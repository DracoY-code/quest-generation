### Description: You may have seen the open grave in our graveyard. Most of the townsfolk think it's the work of a corpse thief. The truth is less pleasant. It is...was, the grave of Vighar, my own ancestor, dead for centuries now. Vighar is a vampire. My family is entrusted with keeping him buried, but recently someone stole the wardstone that sealed him in the grave, and Vighar escaped. It's too late for the wardstone. Vighar must be destroyed. If this gets out, my family will suffer great shame. See that Vighar is destroyed. He will have fled to gather others of his kind at Bloodlet Throne.
