### Response:
My name is Lord Logan Coprith, and I am the High Merchant of Trademeet. A group of Dao genies from Calimshan arrived to Trademeet a while ago. They and their gold were welcome enough at first... But in only weeks, they have taken all business and put a stop to it. They are hunting a rakshasa named Ihtafeer and insist that she is present in the town. The genies will allow no trade to occur until Ihtafeer is found and her head given to them. Why... why they have chosen this particular tactic, I am unsure. Without proper trade, however, the merchants are penniless. Soon, the food resources will dry up as well, so something must be done... and done soon. Perhaps you might be able to look into this genie issue for us? Guildmistress Busya in the next room can tell you more about what needs to be done.
