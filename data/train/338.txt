### Response:
I'm Shahvee. We Argonians have not fared well outside our native Black Marsh, but we're determined to make the best of things. I began praying to Zenithar, the god of wealth, to bring us some fortune, but thieves made off with my sacred amulet almost as soon as I bought it. If you found my Amulet, Shahvee would be in your debt, kind one.
