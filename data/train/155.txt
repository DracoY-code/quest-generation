My boy Leontius lives in Old Hroldan. Old inn to the south. Damn drunk. The oaf doesn't even bother to visit these days. What am I supposed to do if the dragons burn down the farm? You're a traveler, right? I have this letter for him. Let him know how much of a failure he is. You make sure the lug tips you when he gets it.
