### Response:
Greetings, we are Minsc and Boo. Boo is my faithful hamster companion, and more than he seems. We have traveled far to explore this land, but now my charge Dynaheir has been taken from us. 'Twas gnolls, and once we have tracked them I will beat sense into their heads until they release her. Accompany us, and bards will sing the deeds of Minsc and Boo... and friends. Onward to the gnoll stronghold in the west!
