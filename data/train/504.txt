### Response:
I'm Sheogorath, Prince of Madness. And other things. I'm not talking about them. As you should know by now. You've run a maze like a good little rat, but no cheese for you yet. Well, maybe a little. I've granted you a new spell - the ability to summon Haskill, my Chamberlain, to aid you in your travels. He knows a lot. More than he knows. Now we're going to give you a taste of where you have found yourself. You're going to learn. Two halves, two rulers, two places within my palace. Meet and greet. Do what they will, so you know what they're about. The Duke of Mania and the Duchess of Dementia. Seek them out, and let them show you what New Sheoth is. You might be surprised. Once you understand what My Realm is, you might understand why it's important to keep it intact. And maybe you'll make some friends along the way. That's always nice!
