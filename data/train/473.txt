### Response:
We're being harassed by a Priestess of the Bitch Queen Umberlee. We don't even know why, but whenever we attempt to fish she turns the weather sour. Two of us were washed away just walking to the docks, but we cannot prove to the guard it was her. We be needin' someone to strong-arm her into leaving us alone. We've not much money, but I'll gladly give you a... magical weapon from my grandfather's adventuring days. It's a meager amount for your trouble, but it would be a great service to us. Will you help a group of poor fishermen? She hides out near a small shack to the north. Watch yer back and act quickly; she's tricky.
