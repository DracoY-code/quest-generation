<|begin_description|>
Ten years of research down the drain! I've been studying the Welkynd Stones. Yes, the aquamarine colored crystals usually native to Ayleid ruins. It seems I'm the first to discover them growing in a natural cave. That's about all I can say about it. I don't suppose I could convince you to help me recover my research notes? I was doing some research in Bramblepoint Cave, and suddenly I was attacked. I grabbed everything I could and ran, but I fear I dropped my notes. Those notes are very important to me and represent ten years of my life. If you could recover them, I'd be sure to reward you appropriately with some potent potions.
