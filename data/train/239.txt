If you're going out to the Temple Steppes, I could use your help. The Sturmbeorn have set up a makeshift smithy there, and they have two blacksmiths making suits of armor for wild Warbeasts they've captured. Those Sturmbeorn seem to be working from schematics, but they keep them under lock and key. Do you think you might be able to get in there and grab the armor schematics?
