### Description: I know things. Hidden things. Things you aren't supposed to know. I'm not alright! No! That's what I'm trying to say. The secrets. They're in there. In there deep. Can't get them out. They're in my head. They might leak out. Don't want them crawling into your head, too. Like me. The Black Book taught me the secrets. It shoved them in my head. With black slick fingers. My fingers are too short. I can't get them out. I didn't find the Black Book. It found me. Here. I'll show you. See. Right there, in White Ridge Barrow. But don't go there. You don't want these things in your head. You don't!
