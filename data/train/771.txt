My... my name is Renfeld... *groan* I have been poisoned... I beg you to take me to... friends... they have a building not far away from here... please, I beg you! It is a large building... a large orange building in the southwest part of the Docks District. There will be a man guarding the door... his name is Rylock. Please, take me to him... I... I have nothing to offer you... aside from my gratitude and those of my friends. Please... I do not have much time...
