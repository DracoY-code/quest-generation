My family came here centuries ago. We've made a good living smithing the silver that flows through the city. But you probably wanted to know about the fancy carvings and stonework, didn't you? Travelers always do. Here, I have a delivery I need to make to Calcelmo in Understone Keep. Why don't you take the ring to him? He knows the history of Markarth better than anyone. He can be a bit difficult, but I'm sure he'll appreciate your help.
