Good day, it's Dawnbringer Sain, the priest of Lathander. I would ask a dangerous thing of you. You're free to refuse, but the greater glory of Lathander is at stake. The Morninglord takes great pride in the artifacts of his rule. We have many items on display at the temple of Lathander, from new artworks to the aged relics of bygone days. Today we are one less. We are the victims of thievery, and our followers have been shaken by this vulnerability. Quick steps must be taken to rectify this. We know the culprits; they have not concealed their crime. Talassans, slinking from their temple to degrade our worship, hired common thieves for the deed! They fear no retribution. The Morninglord cannot suffer his relics in the hands of such evil. Find these thieves before the Talassans receive the items. The spark of dawn has lit the way. Go to the filth of the slums at night and intercept the delivery of our Dawn Ring. Bring it back to its proper place.
