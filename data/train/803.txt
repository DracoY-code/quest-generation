Why are you people doing this? Is it information you want? This... this is about the inheritance, isn't it? All right! I'll tell you where I've hidden it. It's in a hollowed-out tree stump. In the marsh, south of Solitude. Now please, you'll let me go now. Right? Why don't you be a dear and let me go now. All right? I won't say a word to anyone. Our little secret. I promise.
