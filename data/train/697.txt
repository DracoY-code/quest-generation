I'm Rusia. My husband is General Silgor Bradus, one of County Anvil's commanders in the field. I did quite a bit of traveling. Back before I met Silgor, and decided to settle down. It's all about pacing yourself. You should get out there, and experience things for yourself. Discover new places, travel to lands you've never seen. Maybe once you've done that, we can talk about how to better pace yourself. I'll teach you what I know about athletics. Maybe we can swap stories about life on the road, too.
