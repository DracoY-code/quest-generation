### Response:
You need to get your hands on the Staff of Magnus. Now. I've got to stay here, to see if we can get to Ancano and stop this. I need someone I can trust to do it. If the stories about the staff are true, if it really can absorb a tremendous amount of power, maybe we can break through Ancano's magic. You know that the staff is in Labyrinthian? Are you... Are you sure? The staff is there? That can't be a coincidence. The Arch-Mage. Before... before he died. He... He gave me something just a little while ago. He told me it was from Labyrinthian, and that I would know what to do with it when the time came. I think... I think he meant this for you, then. I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it for him. Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to Savos, but I think would do you the most good now. Take it, and get out of here. Bring back that staff before Ancano brings the whole College down around us. If we can't stop this, what happens to the rest of Skyrim?
