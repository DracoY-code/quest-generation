<|begin_description|>
You could help me with my research. I believe I've discovered a new form of silence. Some philosophers postulate seven orders of silence, but I believe there's an eighth. If you allow me, I'd like to envelop you in the eighth form, to study the mental effects. If this works, I'll prepare a version that you can cast yourself, if you ever wish to inflict... er, study silence.
