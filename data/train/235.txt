### Response:
I do not want to spend my whole life in this village! I want to become an adventurer, like you. Maybe even make a name for myself... Can you please help me start my life as an adventurer? I just need a sword and a suit of armor to keep myself save from danger. You can get swords from weaponsmiths and armor from armorers. I collected some amethyst shards when I was a child dreaming of adventure. You can have them. You may yet find a use for them.
