I feel like my scales are clawing into me. Maybe you could help an old Argonian out? I heard some of the sailors talking about how they stashed a bottle of Double-Distilled Skooma in the Gnisis Cornerclub. I just need a taste. Please, snatch the bottle for me. I'll be waiting for it. Then, let me show you a thing or two about not attracting attention to yourself.
