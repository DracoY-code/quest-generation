### Response:
Greetings, traveler. I am Paarthurnax. Who are you? What brings you to my mountain? Forgive me. I gave in to the temptation to prolong our speech. I know you are Dovahkiin. You have come here to learn from me. Patience. There are formalities that must be observed, at the first meeting of two of the dragons. By long tradition, the elder speaks first. Hear my shout! Feel it in your bones. Match it, if you are Dovahkiin!
