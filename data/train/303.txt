<|begin_description|>
Hey kid, it's me, Fuller. I need a quarrel of crossbow bolts. If you could get some off Winthrop at the inn, I'll reimburse you. there'll be a dagger in it for you too. My father killed a hobgoblin with it once, many years ago. Stabbed him right in the back, he did. It ain't no broadsword, but it'll do in a pinch.
