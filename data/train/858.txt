I am Darsidian Moor, and I hunt a creature known as the skin dancer, a man-like beast without true flesh of its own. I must follow the leads I have found here and confront this creature once and for all. Will you aid me in killing this creature of evil? The skin dancer's lair is just north of the east gate, in a walled-off section of town with an orange pavilion. I intend to travel ahead and scout out the area. Meet me there as soon as possible... I could certainly use your aid.
