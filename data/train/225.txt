Yes, I, Horkvir Bear-Arm, can take a moment to talk with you. I'd get more work done if it weren't for my layabout double living in town. Terrible drain on productivity. Never know who's who. It's been a problem for too long. A wizard did it. Stupid layabout mage. Had a theory about each of us having a Manic and Demented side. He decided to test the theory. Cast a spell. Split us all in two. Do we get twice the work done? No! Ridiculous. We're not allowed to take care of it either. There are rules. And I don't want to end up on the Hill of Suicides. You, on the other hand.... Get rid of that Demented bunch. Useless, anyway. Don't get a lick of work done around Split. If you get rid of them, I'll make it worth your while.
