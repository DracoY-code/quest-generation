It is I, the spirit of the grove, child. Child of nature, you are again needed. Balance is threatened, and Chaos is at the periphery. Will you serve the grove? The grove is young in terms of nature and ancient in the years of man. Centuries ago, Marek of Halruaa established a protectorate of nature in these woods. Now, as Marek knew would someday happen, his descendants have returned and old enemies marshal their forces. A child called Loren has recently arrived in Trademeet. This child is the inheritor of Marek's spirit, but does not yet have the knowledge to use his power. Surely he shall be slain by the forces of chaos if you do not rescue him. Even now he is alone and in danger, his parents slain by an evil that haunts him. You must find the child Loren in Trademeet and fight Marek's old enemies to save the child's life. The spirit that once was Marek has gone forth to aid the child... but the spirit is not the power that the man once was and cannot hope to hold out for long. Aid him lest all be lost.
