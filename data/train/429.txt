<|begin_description|>
I am Fahrington. A tasloi has stolen my scroll of wisdom, wanderer, and fled eastward towards the ettercap's lair. The poor tasloi is probably quite dead by now but the ettercaps, of course, will not recognize the scroll's value. If you could retrieve it for me, I promise to brighten your karma.
