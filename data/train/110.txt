Stop! You have trespassed on our territory. You shall not be allowed to leave until you have paid tribute. We demand 50 gold in tribute! No money? That is too bad for you. We let you go only if you win fight. Your best champion versus our best champion. Our best champion is Ludrug. Ludrug is me. Are you ready for fight? No matter, we fight now! If you lose, you must die! If you win, we must let you pass! Tread carefully, we will be watching you.
