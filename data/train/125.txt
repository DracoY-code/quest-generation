You have it. The Scroll - the Elder Scroll. Time bends... touch. Time shudders at its touch. There is no question. You are doom-driven. Blessings of Akatosh. The very bones of the earth are at your disposal. Go then. Fulfill your destiny. Take the Scroll to the Time-Wound. Do not delay. Alduin will be coming. He cannot miss the signs. You must defeat him.
