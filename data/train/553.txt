Greetings to you. I am Lord Priest Tremain Belde'ar, a humble servant of Our Smiling Lady Tymora. My request of you is an odd and very dangerous one. I will not hold you to it if you deem it too extreme. I would have you enter the Water Queen's House and retrieve my son's, Casson's, body. Casson sought to indulge his restless nature by sneaking about the place, and a high price was paid. You must bring Casson's body to me, that I may restore his life to him.
