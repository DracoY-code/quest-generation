My mommy and daddy say that I can't go outside the village. I don't! But I really wanna have a parrot. The other kids would certainly like me better if I had a cool pet like a parrot! You a big enough to travel to places on your own without your parents. Traveler, please tame a parrot and bring it to me. I even have some seeds for you: tame the parrot with them. Parrots live in jungles. I will give you this diamond I once found on the ground. Even a kid like me knows that those are valuable.
