### Response:
Ah, you need an Elder Scroll. There's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. Let me think... Perhaps the College of Winterhold. What learning there is in Skyrim is gathered there. One of the mages there may be able to put you on the trail of this Elder Scroll. This Elder Scroll might be able to show you the past in some way, and let you learn the Dragonrend shout.
