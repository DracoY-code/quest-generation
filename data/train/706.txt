You're a traveler, correct? Have you been to Whiterun? My daughter, Fura, was assigned to Whiterun after she joined the Imperial Army. I was hoping you might have met her. I haven't heard from her lately. I've tried talking to Captain Aldis but he hasn't been any help. It would be very sweet of you to get more information about my daughter. Anything you can find out from Captain Aldis would be welcome news.
