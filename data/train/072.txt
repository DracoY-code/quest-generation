### Response:
Your timing is perfect, my friend! Below us, in the Dead Shoals, the Crab King is negotiating with a representative of the Ezrohir, to provide the Ezrohir with a huge cache of scrap metal they have salvaged. The Ezrohir will use that scrap to forge more arms to bring against us! They must be stopped! I beg you: Go down into the Dead Shoals and prevent the Crab King from concluding his negotiations with the Ezrohir! I realize this is not much in the way of a reward, but this potion is all I can offer.
