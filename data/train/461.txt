<|begin_description|>
I know of your dark deeds. I do not want any trouble from you. However... if you have had a change of heart, I could use a little help. The hot desert air of this village is making me rather uncomfortable. I could stave off the heat, if I had some ice. Tell you what, bring me ice, and you may still redeem yourself, villain, and net yourself 42 cacti. Ice is commonplace in snowy tundras, in frosted rivers.
