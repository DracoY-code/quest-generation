<|begin_description|>
Commander Vale believes that the Alchemist might attack the Wellspring Temple, in an attempt to reach the Guardian of Water ... for what nefarious purpose I am afraid to speculate. There has been no word from either Vale, or the Guardian. Scout the Wellspring Temple, and determine if the Guardian of Water is in any danger.
