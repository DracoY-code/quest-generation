I was sent here to lead the Thalmor's interests in this corner of the world. It's my mission to root out all Talos worship in this city. You're awfully inquisitive, aren't you? I like that. Perhaps you'd care to solve a little problem I'm having? Ogmund the Skald. He's old, respected, and I know for a fact that he worships Talos in his home. But the Jarl has been hesitant to call for his arrest. I want you to break in to his home and find evidence.
