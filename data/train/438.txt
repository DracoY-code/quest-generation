Welcome! Welcome, my friend. I have numerous enchantments available... weapons, armor, trinkets, and the like. Or, rather, I would, if I hadn't lost my enchantment kit! Maybe you can help me. I've heard there's a Beornen shaman or something out in the Path of the Honored Dead, who has the kind of enchanting tools I need. If you could locate this bear-mage and acquire those tools, I would happily give you your first enchantment, free of charge!
