### Response:
Brithaur's a thorn in my side that never seems to go away! I'd have his heart on a plate if I could! I wish he'd simply disappear from the streets of New Sheoth forever! Oh look, just talking about it has given me another gray hair! Brithaur is a thief, but what irks me the most is that he's a BAD thief. Between my shop and a few others in Crucible, he's been caught stealing maybe a dozen times last month. Who has time for this sort of thing? I mean, at this rate, I'll grow old and die before he's out of our hair! I'll tell you what I tell anyone else who asks. Get rid of him for me and I'll make it worth your while. Do hurry... time's wasting!
