I've caught a mountain of salmon and cod. Yet, there are still some more exotic fish that have eluded my fishing rod. Traveler, do you like fishing? May I ask you to catch 6 tropical fish for me? These sort of fish are common in vast oceans of our world. I yearn to take a look at new kinds of fish. I could even try to breed them. If you happen to give me 6 exotic fish, I'll be glad to reward you with an enchanted fishing rod of mine. A best kind of tool for a passionate fisher.
