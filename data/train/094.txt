<|begin_description|>
I, Nadine, desperately need someone's help. Euric, my youngest son, has run away again... He's always had a touch of the wanderer in him and he knows how to take care of himself, but... Oh, I'm just worried sick. This city gets more dangerous every day... If you find him, could you give him this good luck talisman? I'm sure we'd all sleep a little better. Let me give you this necklace as a token of my thanks upon your return. I don't know if it's worth anything but it has been in the family for years.
