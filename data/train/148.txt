I don't know when nightfall arrives. As night falls, the world is inherited by monsters, and outdoors become much more dangerous! Even within the village! I could be in the middle of some important task, and then a zombie might attack and kill me! You have been helping others: maybe you could help me too. I want a clock to keep track of time more easily. Would you kindly obtain one? I have some blocks of iron for you...
