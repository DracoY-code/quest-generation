I think we both know... it's time to face my father Harkon. If we don't, he'll keep chasing us for the rest of our lives. Well, before we spoke to my mother in the Soul Cairn, I would have said we bring the bow to my father. But after everything with her... I don't think we can trust him. No. He has to die. We have no choice. Let's face him together.
