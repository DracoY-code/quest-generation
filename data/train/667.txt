I am Fade - why have you summoned me? Ah, you want to enter Cacklespit's hidden realm. Yes, I know the way - but I do not provide service without compensation. I have very particular... appetites. The remains of the living are infused with a lingering residue of deeds past, which sustains me. Bring me the skulls of four warriors of renown, and I will take you where you wish to go. This battlefield is littered with the bones of great heroes. Your search should not be difficult.
