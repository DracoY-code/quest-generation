All I can think about is my son, my Thorald... they say that he was killed, but I know better. I know my son is alive! Those Battle-Borns... they're in with the Imperials. They know it too, and yet they lie to my very face! It's not wise to discuss how I know about their lies here. Please, if you truly wish to help, meet me at my home. I'll tell you the whole story.
