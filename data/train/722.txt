Been terrorizing the locals ever since. The Watch is useless, so we step in. Apparently, there are three or four of them. Real nasty, from what I hear. You take care of them. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll surrender. The people of Bravil aren't talking, but you might try asking around, butter them up a bit. Get to it.
