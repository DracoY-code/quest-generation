### Description: The name's Katria. I am - was - an adventurer. Raided ruins like this for nigh on twenty years. I was on the trail of something big. It led me here, and... I didn't make it. Oh. You read the book, didn't you? "The Aetherium Wars"? It was my theory, you know. My research. My life's work. All of it, lost! Stolen by my own damn apprentice! That's how I ended up here. I can't rest. Not until I find the Aetherium Forge, until I can prove that it was my discovery. Mine, not his! Hmm... well, you can pick up where I left off. My notes should still be in my journal, if you can read it. We still have to find the Forge itself. I had a lead on that, too.
