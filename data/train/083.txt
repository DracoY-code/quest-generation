### Description: They found it! They actually found Rjorn's drum! You don't know who Rjorn is? You're joking, right? Rjorn? Only the most famous battle drummer of the second age. Well, famous among bards at least. That drum has been in half a dozen famous battles. It's a priceless artifact. Nobody knows where he died, and therefore where his drum might be. Halldir was the missing link. Rjorn was always looking for new stories to tell. It seems he was writing a lay about Halldir when he vanished. Rjorn entered Halldir's Cairn in secret, and presumably died there. Now all I need to do is find someone to get it. Wait. You. You could do it. I need you to get me that drum. The college treasury is a bit thin right now. But I can show you some tricks I learned from my days with the army.
