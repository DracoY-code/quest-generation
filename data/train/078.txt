### Response:
I be Dennis... the leader of mercenary fellows out o' Riatavin. Me gong was stolen. The gong belonged to my mother... it was her dowry and worth a great deal of coin. A damnable lout stole it before my gong lessons were even finished! The lout sold it to a fence by the name of Roger not too long ago, I do think. He lives in the sewers below th' city, although I knows not exactly where. He might still have it. Please find me family gong!
