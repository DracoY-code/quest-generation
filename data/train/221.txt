I have some thoughts about repairing the White Phial. There are three crucial elements. Some may be easier to find than others. On the top of the Throat of the World is a patch of unmelting snow. No heat can touch it. Then we need the tusk of a mammoth, ground to a fine powder as only the giants know how. The final step is tricky. It requires the briar heart from a Forsworn of the Reach. If you can bring me these materials, the Phial can again be made whole. You can keep the White Phial after I have repaired it. I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of Nurelion's obsession, and how it consumed him.
