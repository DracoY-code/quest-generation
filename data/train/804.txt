### Response:
Oh, please - perhaps you can help us! On the advice of our village's healer, I have traveled here seeking a cure. My cousins are afflicted with the Black Blindness, an ailment peculiar to our race. Black Blindness is an insidious disease - it dims the vision and makes speech impossible, and if not treated within a few weeks, can become permanent. The only known treatment is produced from the flesh of the Blue Boletus - a species of mushroom creatures that grows only in the Fungal Caves near here. I find that they are, ah, BIGGER than I had anticipated, however. Perhaps YOU could retrieve some Blue Boletus flesh for us? We would be forever in your debt!
