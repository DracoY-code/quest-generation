I am Mirili Ulven, a botanist. You're offering to help me with my research? Well... I suppose I could find a use for you, despite your lack of training. Collect some plants for me, will you? Here's the list of things I need. Get me everything on it. Try to remember where you found it so you can tell me. It's important. I will pay you 10 gold coins for each sample.
