### Response:
Come to Olava for a reading, did you? Hmph. Yes. Yes, I surely can give you a reading. It's not something I do lightly, mind you, and it's not as specific as you might want. But yes. I will do this for you. Please, relax. Free your mind. Yes, that's it... A potential for adventure, and wealth. It is a ruin, ripe for the plunder. Deepwood Redoubt. Far to the northwest... Through there is... Hag's End. The last resting place of an assassin of old. A dark brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you. No... no, that is all. Now... now please. I find myself very weary all of sudden.
