You see that Temple? Way up there. All them women, keeping to themselves. Won't let poor Degaine in, no. Not even for a look. But they've got a treasure in there. Gold statue, size of a child. Who knows what they use it for, but I know what I'll use it for. Stealing it and selling it for profit. Well let's not put it like that. Wouldn't want the Thieves Guild catching wind of us, eh? Nah, just creep in and have a go at taking it out. I'll be here, and pay you half of what my man in Riften promised for it. You'll be helping out an old beggar, and the gods smile on that sort of thing.
