Your next assassination target is Lurbuk. He is staying at Moorside Inn in Morthal. Lurbuk is, by all accounts, the worst bard in all of Skyrim. No one would hold it against you if you flayed that horrible bard alive and made a drum from his skin... Apparently so many people sought his death, a lottery had to be arranged to determine the client. The only good bard is a dead one, as far as I'm concerned. All that singing and... mirth.
