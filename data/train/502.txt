You have got quite a reputation. Not a very positive one, mind you! I, on the other hand, seek to become famous in more positive terms: I want to become a zookeeper. For that I'm going to need some animals to showcase. There exist special, playful pandas who love to roll around. I want one. This is your chance to bring a bit joy to this world: bring me a playful panda for my zoo. First, you have to find one and put a lead on it. Here, take this lead. When you return with the panda, I'll give you a saddle in return.
