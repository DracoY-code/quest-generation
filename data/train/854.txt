### Description: This is the only entrance to the Broken Mines that we've found, so the Alchemist is almost certainly in there. That probably means he's near his goal, whatever that is... and that means he'll do everything he can to keep you from stopping him. He'll be even more desperate, more dangerous. I don't know what we'll encounter in there.
