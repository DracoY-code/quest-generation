Please wait a moment, kind traveler! You've got to help me! My name is Lena. You must forgive me for my appearance, but I've been wandering the wilderness for more than a week now. My friend is badly hurt, and he might die if he doesn't get assistance soon. His name is Sam. If you were to take him to Gellana Mirrorshade at the Temple of Wisdom, she'd help him. Please, can you do this?
