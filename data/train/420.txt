Are you here to help? Finally, reinforcements have arrived. I was expecting more though, you'd better be good. We left to help with the war and these filth bags swooped in and seized the place. I suspect Brurid planned this, there's been bad blood between us since the king's death. But to invade my home, kidnap my family... The front gate is locked so you'll need to use the mine entrance behind us. Open the front gate and we'll try and give you some support. My family is everything to me. Clear the fort and on top of the posted reward you can have whatever items you'd like.
