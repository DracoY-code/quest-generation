My daddy said that horses and donkeys can make babies together. I want to see what their babies look like! You are a grown-up! You ought to know how to tame and breed animals. Please show me a baby donkey-horse! I have seen both donkeys and horses eating grass an plains and savannas. Try to tame one of both and make them breed! Show me a baby horse-donkey, and I'll give you some golden apples. They're incredibly tasty... and so shiny!
