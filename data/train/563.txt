<|begin_description|>
I fear the Alchemist is a pawn of the Netherim. With the power of the Guardians, a portal to the Nether Realm could be thrown wide, and the world would be plunged into an age of never-ending torment. Return to the Enclave immediately. Commander Vale can help you secure passage to the Ossean Wastes, where two of my fellow Guardians can be found. Stop the Alchemist before he can drain them as well!
