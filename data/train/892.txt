### Description: We've got to find Esbern in Riften before the Thalmor do. He'll know how to stop the dragons if anybody does. You'd better get to Riften. Talk to Brynjolf. He's... well-connected. A good starting point at least. Oh, and when you find Esbern... if you think I'm paranoid... you may have some trouble getting him to trust you. Just ask him where he was on the 30th of Frostfall. He'll know what it means.
