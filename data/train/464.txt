There is a strange woman living alone out in the Lily Forest. Some say that she knows the meaning of life! Could you find her in that flower forest, and ask her about it? I really want to hear what could possibly be the meaning of life. When you return, I'll have a little something for you. A compass. May it point you toward your destinations in life!
