### Response:
I am Hermaeus Mora, the Gardener of Men, knower of the unknown, master of fates. You stand in my realm, mortal. You have sought out the forbidden knowledge that only one other has obtained. You are a seeker of knowledge and power, like Miraak before you. The Skaal have withheld their secrets from me for many long years. The time has come for this knowledge to be added to my library. Convince them to give up their secrets. My word is as true as fate, as inevitable as destiny. Bring me what I want, and I will give you what you seek.
