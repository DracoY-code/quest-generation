### Description: Perhaps you can help me. I'm Maeva the Buxom. My husband's name is Bjalfi the Contemptible. My father said I was a fool to marry him, but I didn't listen. At our wedding, my father gave us a family heirloom as a gift; Rockshatter, a mace that's been in my family for many generations. Bjalfi snatched Rockshatter from our mantle and took off to "find his fortune" with the local Marauder gang at Fort Strand. I want that mace back. Please, I don't think he's ever coming back, and I'd hate to lose such a precious heirloom to a gang of thugs.
