You... would not believe what has been occurring. We are finally making progress in rehearsals, and now... other things are happening... We've had props inexplicably fall from tables! A cistern broke and ruined an entire backdrop! An actress slipped yesterday and almost broke her foot! There's been other strange things, too... noises during the night, creakings and moanings. One of the stagers almost died falling out of the rafters! All the actors are frightened; they believe the curse is assailing us, and I... am beginning to believe it too. Oh, what a fool I was to disregard it! You are the patron of the playhouse... I need you to talk to someone who has offered to help.
