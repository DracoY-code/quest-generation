Hmph. I am Sarhedra and I don't like you. I bet you're another one of those adventurers wantin' to change the world or somethin'. Well, go pick on the ogres to the south if it will make you feel better. Go find someone else to talk to, I'm no good at this quest stuff. I have... ummm... people to see and places to be.
