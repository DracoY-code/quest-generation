### Response:
I could use some help with getting organized. An assistant perhaps? No, no, no. Maybe a familiar. No, too messy. Well, at any rate, organization is not my strong suit. Not at all. I need as much help as I can get. In fact, if you could retrieve a few things for me, I could start on my next set of experiments. What I need is my Dwemer Spoon, my Orichalcum Ingot and my Grand Soul Gem. In fact, I could use them immediately. Well... why are you still standing here? Oh, right. You need to know where they are! That would help. Let's see. Last time I used the Dwemer Spoon was at my dear friend Boti's house in Ivarstead... Fellstar Farm I believe it's called. The Orichalcum Ingot should still be in Winterhold at the Frozen Hearth Inn. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me. And last is the gem. I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well. Bring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you.
