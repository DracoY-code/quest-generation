Name's Mironda. Pleased to see yer face and make its acquaintance. I'm no good with names; if ye can remember mine, ye've already beaten me. I forgot yers by the end of the first syllable. Maybe it's the wild mage in me comin' out, but I can't stand not tastin' something new once in a while. Most dwarves will drink the same mountain swill from crib to dust-crib, but I'm always hankering for the latest brew. Old Vyatri in Trademeet was just getting a shipment from Luiren I'd dearly love to sample. If ye happen to run by his place in yer travels, get a cask of it for me and I'll pay ye well! Can't wait to taste it. Halfling's Help, it's called â€” I hope it works on dwarves, too
