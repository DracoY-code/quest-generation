### Response:
It was you that lured me here and took me prisoner... I have done nothing to earn your distrust. Wisdom sees the doorway. It would be wise to recognize when you only have one choice. You can trust me. I am not treacherous. Alduin has proven himself unworthy to rule. I go my own way now. He has traveled to Sovngarde to regain his strength, devouring the souls of the mortal dead. A privilege he jealously guards... His door to Sovngarde is at Skuldafn, one of his ancient fanes high in the eastern mountains. I surely do not need to warn you that all his remaining strength is marshaled there. Free me, and I will carry you to Skuldafn so that you can face Alduin in battle. I warn you, once you've flown the skies, your envy of the dragons will only increase.
