Please, kind spirits, a wondrous ancient oak is in peril. It is the tree to which I am bonded! If it dies, I, Dryad of the Cloud Peaks, die. It is about to be attacked by two who would defile the majesty of nature. They have avoided my charms and must be stopped before irreparable harm is done. Would you heed my plea? There is a potion that might help you on your journeys.
