<|begin_description|>
I have everything in place for the ritual. I'll open the portal whenever you're ready. I don't know what you'll find in Camoran's Paradise. I do know the portal I create through the Mysterium Xarxes ritual will close behind you. You'll have to find another way back. I believe that Mankar Camoran acts as the "anchor" for Paradise, just as a sigil stone anchors an Oblivion Gate in place. Kill Mankar Camoran, and you will unmake his Paradise. Farewell, my friend. Our fate is in your hands. Bring back the Amulet of Kings. Brace yourself.
