### Response:
I am Harkon, lord of this court. By now, my daughter will have told you what we are. We are among the oldest and most powerful vampires in Skyrim. You have done me a great service, and now you must be rewarded. There is but one gift I can give that is equal in value to the Elder Scroll and my daughter. I offer you my blood. Take it, and you will walk as a lion among sheep. Men will tremble at your approach, and you will never fear death again. However, if you refuse my gift you will be prey, like all mortals. I will spare your life this once, but you will be banished from this hall. I await your decision.
