Hail! It's rare to see another traveler out in the wilderness. I'm a wandering merchant by trade: I travel from village to village to sell my merchandise. You wouldn't mind helping me out a bit in exchange for an enchanted book? I'd like you to promote my services in nearby villages: Seaside Settlement, Desert Refuge, and Stoneburg. I am already fairly well-known in the coastal Seaside Settlement, so you just gotta tell the villagers there that I am coming there soon. For the villagers of Desert Refuge out in the desert, I have some promotional items that I want you to hand out. Lastly, I want you to give some coupons to the villagers of the mountainous Stoneburg. Good luck in your promotional mission!
