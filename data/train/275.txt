### Response:
The Artificer and the Alchemist might be formidable, but even their combined powers are nothing more than parlor tricks to one such as me. I can easily undo anything that they have done to your "Guardian." I will of course require something in return. My only real enemy in this desert is boredom. I will make you a bargain: Perform three tasks for my amusement. If your struggles provide suitable entertainment, then, and only then, will I free your Guardian. Your first task: Journey to the Sadwa Mesa, and recover my Lamp of Wonders from the Tu'tara!
