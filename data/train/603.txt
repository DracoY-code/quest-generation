I daresay you've learned all I can teach you about Destruction magic. But... That doesn't mean there isn't more out there. Over the years I've heard things. Powerful magics lost to the ages, incredible spells that only the most skilled mages can master. This book, "Power of the Elements", is the only thing I've ever found. I think it's better off in your hands.
