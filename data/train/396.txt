### Response:
Torbjorn Shatter-Shield is giving me trouble. I wish someone would beat the coin out of his fat fists. He clings to every coin. He says an Argonian's labor is only worth a tenth of a "proper Nord worker." My people are not slaves! You can try talking with him, but we've gotten nowhere talking to him ourselves.
