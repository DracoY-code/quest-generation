My name is Safana and I can make you richer than you could imagine. I know where the pirate Black Alaric dumped his greatest trove of treasure. Knowing that you are a dynamic and intelligent person, I know you'd want to join me in a venture to get this treasure. Well, we should be off then. From what my map showed, the pirate cove is located somewhere along the coast, just south of Candlekeep.
