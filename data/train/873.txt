Ohhhh... what am I, S'jirra, to do? They're gone... all gone. Can you help me find my lost Jumbo Potatoes? Please, you must help me find them! If I don't have them for the next batch of my famous potato bread, I don't know what I'll do! My potatoes are like my children. I care for and nurture each one individually. That way, they grow up to be big and strong. How stupid I was to leave them outside all alone like that! All I wanted to do was give them some sun. Next thing I knew, they were gone! I saw someone running off to the west, but I'm too frightened to journey into the woods alone. Please... can you help me? I'll give you my famous potato bread. I swear!
