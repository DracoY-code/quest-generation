### Response:
My daughter Fjotli... she was murdered a few months ago. Left her laying on the ground in a pool of her own blood. I assume they were after her valuables... she always wore far too much jewelry in public. When I told her it'd be the death of her, I never thought... No need to explain, I'm well aware of your Guild's methods do not include killing. It took me weeks, but I finally tracked down the killer. A bloody Altmer at that. Can you imagine? Let's just say I'm a firm believer in an eye for an eye and leave it at that. The killer fancied himself a thief in some sort of a new Guild forming around here. Gave me some valuable information before... well, you know. Well, I think we can help each other. You recover what I'm looking for and take out a rival Guild in the process. One of the pieces stolen from Fjotli was a silver locket, a Cruel-Sea family heirloom. I want it back. The only name I have is Niranye. Has a house right here in Windhelm. That's where you should begin looking.
