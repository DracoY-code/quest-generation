### Response:
Hello, my name is Tove. "The Unrestful," they call me. So much to do, and so little time. There's only one of me to go around, you know! I keep forgetting that most people don't remember when we'll meet in the future. Wait, this is yesterday's future. I'm the one that's confused. Anyway, you're going to help me find calipers and tongs. No point in denying it. You've already agreed tomorrow. I'm using them to build my skyboat. Just between you and me, the hardest part has been getting the water to not fall out of the air. Now if I can just get the water to fly through the air. That's what the calipers and tongs are for. I need them to keep the water airborne. Are you willing to sell me calipers and tongs? Five gold each, just like I told you next week.
