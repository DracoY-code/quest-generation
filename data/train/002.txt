I have been expecting you. I am the Guardian of Air. The Guardian of Mana has pursued the Alchemist into the Forsaken Vaults, which are guarded by the Sphinx. Seek the Vaults, and convince the Sphinx to grant you entry. The Guardian of Mana is in great danger... if not from the Alchemist, then from the Netherim. Save her.
