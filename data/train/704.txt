<|begin_description|>
I have been dead a very long time, and in all those centuries, I have not found one soul worthy of taking up the mantle of hero, as I once did, and seeking adventure. Will you be that hero? I offer you five challenges. Defeat each of the five Spectral Champions in Crows' Pass: these ghostly champions will be your challenges. Should you master them all, my most prized possession is yours...
