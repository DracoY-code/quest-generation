I hate working the forge all day long. People should learn to make their tools themselves! Arrgh! I'm sorry friend. I'm just feeling quite cranky at the moment. My bed is all lumpy and uncomfortable. If only I had a better bed. That would surely improve my mood! Could you, perhaps, obtain a bed for me? I'd prefer a green bed. Help your friend get rest at night. I'd be even willing to part from 32 emeralds for a good bed.
