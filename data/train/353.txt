### Response:
Hello, good people. I am Maralee. Two moons ago my husband took my son out hunting with him. They were attacked by those horrible wolf-creatures. They... they killed my husband and took my baby. Others say that they took the baby away to eat him, but I know he's still alive. He's a beautiful little boy with dark hair like his father. He is three moons old and his name is Peladan. They took him from my husband northeast of the village, in the woods.
