### Response:
That's... complicated. And I'm not totally sure if I can trust you. But if you want to know the whole story, help me get back to my family's home. My family used to live on an island to the west of Solitude. Not the most welcoming place, but depending on whose around, I'll be safe there. My father and I don't really get along. Ugh, saying it out loud makes it sound so... common. "Little girl who doesn't get along with her father." Read that story a hundred times. Hopefully we can find a boat to take us to my family's home.
