<|begin_description|>
I'd like to bake my delicious honey cakes for the whole village! Then they'd certainly know that I have traveled all over the world! I even used to be a wandering trader. I need a lot of honey for the cakes. You are quite a wanderer yourself. Perhaps you could help me procure 10 honey blocks. You can get honey from bees; you just have to find them first. Do this for me, and I'll give you a special reward: a Shulker Box. These things were worth their weight in emeralds every time someone murdered my pack llamas: they made hauling my stock much easier.
