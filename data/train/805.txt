I am Durlyle, and I am glad to be meeting. I have but a mundane task to ask of you, if you hear me out? The storm you felt that took your ship? It was fierce here too, and a cloak that draped the village center was cast to the wind. I think it is beyond the wall, and will not risk the beasts to get it. Will you?
