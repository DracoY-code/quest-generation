I'm with the Imperial Legion. Train the recruits. Turn boys into men. That sort of thing. Thinking of asking the General for some training books. Give the soldiers something to do while they're on rest. Something besides drinking. Ever seen a book called "The Mirror"? We used to hand it out to boys looking to learn basic shield work. If you find a copy of "The Mirror", I'd be glad to have it. Then I'll see if I can get some copies made for the men.
