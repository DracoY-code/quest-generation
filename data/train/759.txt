My mind weighs heavy enough. Idgrod's so lost in her visions, and it's only getting worse. I've looked after her safety for so long... If she can't tell what's real and what's not, how will she continue to lead Morthal? There is a letter, one I have had for some time now. I think it is time it gets delivered. I cannot leave Idgrod's side, so I must stay here. Could you see that it reaches Captain Aldis in Solitude? Please, do not open it. It is... private.
