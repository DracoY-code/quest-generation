### Response:
Well, well. You are much more determined... and capable... than I had suspected! Excellent... Now, to your final task. If you truly wish to free the Guardian, you must humiliate my old rival, Ezrek Khan, by stealing his precious Lamp of Marvels. Be warned: Ezrek Khan draws his power from the same source as the Netherim. His realm borders closely on theirs; they will almost certainly stand against you, should you challenge the djinni.
