You've got to help me! I conjured an Ash Guardian and now it's running amok in Tel Mithryn. Master Neloth refused to teach me the Ash Guardian spell. So I read his spell book on my own and learned it. Something went wrong when I cast it. The creature is attacking everything in sight. I need to keep Master Neloth distracted so he doesn't find out what I did. There is no telling what he would do to me. While you are taking care of the creature, I'll try to figure out what went wrong. I don't have any gold to pay you with, but I can give you this staff.
