### Response:
I am Raelis Shai, the leader of this merry troupe. The vagaries of fortune blow an ill wind over us. One of our members is absent due to circumstances we cannot control. You must hear our story. One of our actors, Haer'Dalis, has been kidnapped by a wizard native to this city... he has made no effort to negotiate with us. The wizard's greed may have called to him at the sight of Haer'Dalis's beloved gem... something our sparrow would not gladly surrender. So this wizard has stolen both away, and there is nothing we can do. I would ask that you return our sparrow and his gem to us both, by whatever means possible. The wizard's name is Mekrath, I believe... I know that his lair can be accessed through the city's sewers, though where exactly it lies is a mystery. We are but a destitute troupe of players, child, and can afford little. Mekrath may have treasure of his own... Wrest it from his grasp if you wish to do so.
