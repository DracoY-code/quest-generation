### Response:
We're all trying to become better mages, right? Well, I need someone I can practice a few spells on. Nothing dangerous, really. Would you be willing to assist me? I can't practice that kind of spell on myself. Believe me when I say I wouldn't be asking if it weren't necessary. You just have to stand there... You might wish to help out one of your fellow mages. If that is not enough, I have this amulet you could take.
