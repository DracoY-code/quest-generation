<|begin_description|>
I am a sea captain by inheritance, as my men are fond of saying. Can't blame them, my mother ran the Sea Squall as strictly as she ran the house. I've been trying to find new areas of business, trying to win the sailors' respect, but I keep having problems. Take the last trade we did. Some Fine-Cut Void Salts from the College of Winterhold. Plenty of coin if you know who to sell it to. What happened to the Salts? Sailors are what happened to them. They got drunk and ended up losing the merchandise in some cave. If you're not afraid of little exploring, I'll pay good gold to get those Salts.
