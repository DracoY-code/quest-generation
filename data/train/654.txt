Who enters? Will nobody save poor Melka? You, meat! Come, come. Don't leave poor Melka to die. Pretty, pretty flesh. Let me out! Petra! Evil Petra put me in a cage, stole my tower. Hate her, chew her bones! Let me out, kind, kind meat. Ah, I have a pretty staff. Help me find Petra, wring her neck, pluck her eyes. Take my prize staff, I just want my tower back!
