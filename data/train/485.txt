### Response:
I have a slightly more personal request. You see, I'm a collector. Of staffs. Magical staffs. In particular, those made by Azra Nightwielder. Azra Nightwielder was the original shadowmage. His advances in magic are legendary. Less well known is that he was also a pioneer in the field of enchanting staffs. Nightwielder's creations don't really hold up in comparison to what can be made today, but they have a sentimental value for me. You understand. Through some divinations, I believe I've located one of Azra Nightwielder's staffs in Frostmere Depths. If you retrieve it, I'll give you a staff of my own making.
