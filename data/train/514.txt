### Response:
Everything you see is grown at my family's own Hollyfrost Farm. Fresh and filling. I also do a little herb growing. The court wizard, Wuunferth, pays us to plant a little Nightshade. Who knows what he uses it for? A poison like that? Hey, could you deliver this bottle of Nightshade extract to Wuunferth?
