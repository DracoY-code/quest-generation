### Description: Greetings, traveler. I am Azura, known as the Queen of Dawn and Dusk. I have seen your name, traveler, and heard it whispered in twilight. I ask a service, which holds promise of fame and reward. Many years ago, five followers of mine slew the vampire Dratik and its kin, but all were infected by the foul creature. Knowing their fate, they sealed themselves up in the vampire's lair. Their suffering weighs heavily on me. Five bright candles shall burn forever in memory of their sacrifice. Travel to the Gutted Mine. The door will open to you. Bring the peace of death to my followers, and you shall earn my gratitude. For your service, you shall have my Star, that your deeds might be entered in the Book of Fate.
