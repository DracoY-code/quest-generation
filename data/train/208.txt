My child, my temple could use a donation. I have to tend the sick and needy: I cannot procure all my potion ingredients myself. I often have to participate in rather complicated trades for the ingredients. Please, help a humble servant of the Gods: bring me 9 diamonds. I know that they are rare, but you can find still find them in ancient ruins, and even deep within the Overworld itself. I have a vast surplus of some potion ingredients that cannot be traded further: I can give you 64 Glowstone Dust for your time and effort.
