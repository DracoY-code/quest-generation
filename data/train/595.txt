<|begin_description|>
I know many things. I have studied things beyond the reach of most humans, traveled the other planes, seen things one should not see. I have met gods and long-dead races of people and everything in between and I know enough to see a vampire where others would see a man. I met several of your kind during my studies of life-extending magics. I even considered becoming a vampire myself. In the end, vampirism would endanger my ward Agni which would defeat the intended purpose. It is possible to cure vampirism. I know of a ritual but I've never performed it. It requires a filled black soul gem. You will need to kill someone. When you have a gem and have filled it return to me and I will perform the ritual. I will bring life to your dead body, vampire.
