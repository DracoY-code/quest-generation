### Response:
Traveler, I'm worried about my fellow villagers here in the village. I don't think that they eat enough nutritious, tasty fish. Could you help me gather more? I simply can't catch enough fish for everyone, even if I'm a pro fisherman. There is a river, Salmon Steps, bountiful in salmon near here. You could try your luck there, and catch 16 fish for me. I could pay you 32 shiny, green emeralds for the fish.
