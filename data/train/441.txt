Please... I implore you, help me, Corrick Northwode, avenge my wife's death! Barely a week ago, I left Harm's Folly to go buy supplies as I usually do once a month. What a fool I was to leave my wife alone. The goblins must have been watching me, as they knew right when to strike. I could hear her screams from far away. Those wretched beasts killed her! Filthy animals! Had I only been there to stop them! I'll tell you how you can help. Go to Exhausted Mine. Kill those goblins. Every last one of them! They destroyed everything I hold dear! In their greed, the creatures grabbed a jade amulet off of Kayleen's... body. Bring me back that amulet, so I may use it to remember her by. Please, I'll give you six gems as a token of my gratitude. They're all I have left of value, but you must have them if you do the deed.
