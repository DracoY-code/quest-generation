Mara is the Goddess of Love. The temple spreads her gifts by tending to the sick, the poor, and the lost. We also perform wedding ceremonies for all the loving couples. You wish to be married to your future spouse? It's good to see love blossoming, even during these difficult times. Your wedding will be held tomorrow, from dawn until dusk, in the Temple of Mara.
