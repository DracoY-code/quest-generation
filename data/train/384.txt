I'm from from here. I've wandered a bit, but I always come back to Kynesgrove. My clan was one of the first to settle here. Legend says that my forefather Lenne discovered the mines after he stumbled into a dark cave to relieve himself. Too much mead. Of course, there's another story of Lenne losing the family shield in a different cave, so it depends on who you believe. According to my grandfather at least, the family shield should be in the cave. He swore that version of the legend was true, even found the cave old Lenne stumbled into: Ansilvund. Hey, if you find it, I could show you some of the clan's favorite fighting moves. They're all shield techniques.
