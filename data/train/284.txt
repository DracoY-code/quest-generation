<|begin_description|>
I am Jiub. Some call me Saint Jiub. Others call me Jiub the Eradicator. Perhaps you've heard of me? If you haven't, I can't say that I am surprised. Until I get my second volume published, no one will ever know of my achievements. In order to write the second volume of my opus, I need the notes from my first volume. Otherwise I need to do all of this from memory. When I was tossed in here I felt myself fallingâ€¦ and I dropped the pages I had been holding. There were ten of them in all. Find them for me, please, I beg you!
