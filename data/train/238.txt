### Response:
I am Teos, a Cowled Wizard, and I have been assigned to offer you... a special deal. You just recently took this sphere, and by all rights we should have it, but my superiors said to offer an alternative. It would seem we have need of you. That said, they would like to offer an exchange. You may operate in this awkwardly placed sphere if you agree to certain duties for the Cowled Wizards. It is simple: You may have this place and act freely as a wizard. In exchange, you do the odd task for us, acting when we can't because of political or other reasons.
