<|begin_description|>
I love to tell stories to others. I'd like to bolster my reputation as a storyteller with some novel, unheard stories about the Nether. To recount its dangers and hellish nature... A witness' account of a Nether Fortress would help me devise some dashing tales. A terrible fortress with equally terrible inhabitants... Would you be my witness? Please, go to the Nether and find a Nether Fortress. Visit it, and tell me all about it. I'll have a diamond for you. It should entice you to help me.
