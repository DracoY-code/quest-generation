I am Bodhi, and I greet you warmly. There is a monopoly in this town, and I intend to break it. I will ask you to weaken the "resources" of the Shadow Thieves. I wish a campaign of disruption, and you will begin it. There is a shipment of supplies arriving by boat. You are to... confiscate it. I suggest you move against that ship coming in. They won't be at the docks for long, and if you do not get the cargo in the next few days, you will fail. Farewell and good fortune.
