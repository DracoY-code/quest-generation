My name be Bolumir, priest of Tempus, the god of battles! Hahr... it has been some time since I have rested my feet in any place, to tell the truth. I've been wandering for many a year now. The traveling does wear on me, to tell the truth. I've come to ask if you've a chapel that a priest of Tempus might set himself up in... bring the good Word to the folk of the area. What do you say, eh? If my manner does not strike you as offensive, I would be glad to be chaplain of your wee keep here. I can help your people here much while I stay. But I do not promise to stay for long. Either you accept me or you don't, my liege... that is your choice, and I'll not begrudge it you.
