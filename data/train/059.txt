### Response:
My name is Delainy, and I am pleasured to meet ye. I seek the return of an item, more an icon. No doubt you felt the storm that passed just by and by? Village-home did as well, and the cloak that draped the village center was cast to the wind. I think it is beyond the wall, and will not risk the beasts to get it. Will you? I can offer little besides my gratitude. The cloak is a keepsake, a symbol of old times.
