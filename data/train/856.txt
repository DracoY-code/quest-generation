### Response:
You are the person who's been causing trouble in these parts, aren't you? Why don't we put your energy to a better use? I'm a mason, which means that I have to move large quantities of stone from one place to another. I'd like to automate that process with pistons. That would save me from backache. The problem is I don't have the materials for making pistons, or the know-how to craft them. This is where you enter the picture. Craft 10 pistons, and then bring them to me. I know that you need 3 wooden planks, 4 cobblestone, an iron ingot, and Redstone Dust for crafting a piston. Some quarts pillars broke while we were transporting them. You could have the remaining 32 Nether Quartz from them.
