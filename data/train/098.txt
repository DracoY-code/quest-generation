Greetings, traveler. You would seek restoration training from me? Your courage is admirable, but now is not the time. Once Kvatch is safe from these attackers, then we might speak of training. While Daedra still roam free in Kvatch, I can think of nothing else. When my city is safe, then I will train you.
