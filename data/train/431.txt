### Response:
Hello... don't mind me... Amiable Fanriene. I'm a little tired. Can't sleep at home, you know. The walls. They aren't safe. I need someplace to sleep. I have seen some people sleeping out on the street, but they huddle too close to the walls. I need someplace safe. I can't just sleep anywhere. There're walls and statues and all sorts of things that can fall on me. Can't have that. Nope. But... if you find me a good place to sleep, a safe place -- outside -- I'll reward you! Remember, walk lightly, and always look up.
