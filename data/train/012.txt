Perhaps... perhaps you are the type of people who can help me. I am in need of someone to... perform a service for me. I need someone... removed. This scoundrel is no innocent! He threatens to ruin my life with... with the spreading of... accusations. He threatens to ruin my reputation and standing unless I pay him an exorbitant sum almost weekly! I beg of thee... you must help me. His name is Cyrdemac and he frequents the Elfsong Tavern. I have not been there myself, but I hear it is quite a rough place. You could do the deed in the main bar itself and likely none would call the guards. I know not if he will have friends with him though. Thank you for this. Upon your return I shall pay you 2,000 gold. A small price to have this embarrassment removed.
