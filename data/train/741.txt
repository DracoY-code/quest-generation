Hey there, you're new here, aren't you? Could I, Joia, trouble you a moment? I need someone to go club some heads for me. I was ambushed by a band o' hobgoblins within sight of this inn's walls. Robbed me blind, they did, and I want to return the favor. I don't care about most of my things, but I want to get my ring back. My father gave it to me, you understand? The creatures were just north of the inn. Bring my ring back here when you get it. You'll know it when you see it. It's a Flamedance Ring, and very striking.
