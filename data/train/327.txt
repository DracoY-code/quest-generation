### Characters: Jauffre - the male Grandmaster of the Blades (location: ), Tiber Septim - the legendary male Emperor who ascended to divinity (location: )
### Tools: Martin needs the blood of a Divine for the ritual to open the portal to Camoran's Paradise in addition to the first item, the blood of a Daedra
### Description: I've figured out another item needed for the ritual to open the portal to Camoran's Paradise. The second item is the counterpart to the first: the blood of a Divine. This was a terrible puzzle to me. Unlike the Daedra, the gods have no artifacts, and do not physically manifest themselves in our world. How then to obtain the blood of a god? But Jauffre solved it. The blood of Tiber Septim himself, who became one of the Divines. This is a secret remembered only by the Blades, passed down from one Grandmaster to the next. Jauffre should tell it to you himself.
