This whole thing is dirty to the core, that's what I know! These aren't your ordinary bandits here. Tazok's been making regular visits to the Cloakwood, so that's where I'd start if I were you. There are some documents in that chest that might be worth taking a look at, too. Now go step on some toes, all right? And you can tell them Ender Sai sent you.
