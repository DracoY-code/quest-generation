### Response:
I need your help with something. Something private. I may have entered into an... agreement with Enthir. He had something I needed, so I traded him something of mine. It was a mistake, and now I want back what I gave him. It's an amulet that belonged to my family, and I never should've given it to Enthir. But he won't deal with me. Talk to him; see what it'll take to get my amulet back.
