Goldenglow Estate is a bee farm; they raise the wretched little things for honey. It's owned by some smart-mouth wood elf named Aringoth. We had an arrangement with Maven. We kept an eye on Goldenglow Estate to make sure the honey kept flowing. In return, Maven allowed us to extort Aringoth and bring in a huge payout. Goldenglow Estate brought in a mountain of gold for the Guild. You could almost call it our sweetest deal. Then out of the clear blue, Aringoth stops sending us our cut. Mercer was... well, angry to put it kindly. We need you to teach Aringoth a lesson by burning down three of the estate's hives and clearing out the safe in the main house. The catch is that you can't burn the whole place to the ground. Maven would be furious if you did. She also prefers that Aringoth remains alive, but if he tries to stop you from getting the job done, kill him. The Guild has a lot riding on this. Don't make me look foolish by mucking it up.
