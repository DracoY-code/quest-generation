My research occupies nearly all of my time. Now that I think about it, I do have a small problem concerning Erthor. He's one of the guild mages here. Think you can do something about it? I just don't have the time to search for him again, but I do need to consult him about some notes he borrowed. You might want to ask around the Guild Hall, and see if anyone can be of some help. Let me know when he's back, and you'll have your recommendation.
