### Response:
Well met, traveler. Gandolar Luckyfoot, at your disposal. If I might pull on your coattail a moment more, I have a proposition for you. It's usually nature-quiet by the Firewine ruins, even with its violent bygone. Those who died and did not sleep have mostly found their rest over time. It's a live threat that comes now, with a band of kobolds that moved in. Perhaps we could prevail upon you to rid us of this menace, and in return, a gift from us you shall receive. Keep whatever you find as well.
