The Silver Hand attacked us. They finally found enough courage to attack Jorrvaskr. We fought them off, but... The old man... Kodlak... he's dead. No one else got hurt, but they made off with all our fragments of Wuuthrad. But you and I are going to reclaim them. We will bring the battle to their chief camp, Driftshade Refuge. There will be none left living to tell their stories. Only songs of Jorrvaskr will be sung. We will avenge Kodlak. And they will know terror before the end.
