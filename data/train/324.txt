I just escaped with my life from a friggin' Elder Guardian, and now I run into you, my least favorite person in the whole world. The damn Elder Guardian swallowed the hook, line, and sinker of my fishing rod while I was out in the sea fishing on my boat. It must have eaten the whole fishing rod after it slipped from my grip into the sea. I shouldn't have gone fish so close to the ocean monument far south of this village. I just couldn't see the turquoise stones that make up the monument before it was too late. Who even built those dangerous underwater temples anyway? I have a proposition for you: recover my fishing rod from the Elder Guardian, and I'll set you up with enough cooked salmon to last your lifetime. We might even become friends. First, you have to find the Elder Guardian, and kill it. Elder Guardians are one-eyed, large, pale, evil pufferfish. They can shoot laser, and make you fatigued when you get close to them.
