There are all sorts of people wandering around carryin' their valuables on their person... just waitin' for someone like you to pick their pocket. So, you in for a little fishin'? One of our marks seems to have an item of value we want to add to our vault. Get it for us and you'll receive the usual pay. Sound good?
