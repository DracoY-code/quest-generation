### Response:
Greetings, greetings, greetings! I am Higgold, director of fine theatricals, musicals, and other entertainments. Most recently from Calimport, where I needn't return quickly due to the sensitivity of one particular huzzah... ..but we needn't get into that. Now, let's see... yes, mm-hm... yes, this looks like a fine playhouse. I know a few actors that aren't working, but it'll take some time to find them, as well as a worthy play to put into production. A week for that, I think. About six weeks after that for rehearsing and then this playhouse of yours should start making decent coin, so long as all goes well. Your part, my good friend, is to provide the investment to stage the play as well as make important decisions. You'll also reap the majority of the profits. I'll start looking for actors and a play right away. It shouldn't take more than half a week, and I'll send word as soon as I'm ready to go.
