I'm proud to say that I grow or harvest most of my exotic ingredients myself. I only wish I had a better source for Netch jelly. Those creatures are difficult to track down since it's so dangerous beyond the the town walls. Could you gather some Netch jelly for me? That would be splendid! Five samples should be enough. I'd be more than happy to give you something for the effort.
