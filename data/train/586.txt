There is always work. My mind is someplace else, though. I think that maybe Kodlak was right. As a werewolf, I can't be a good Nord. I want to be clean, like he was, and go to Sovngarde when I finally die. Aela said we would need a Hagraven's head. I already have one of them, but she said it was a special kind. And that you knew where to get more. Let's go find one!
