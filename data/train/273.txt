Mushrooms are awesome! I love everything about them! Their texture, their taste... Some travelers claim to have seen some huge, giant mushrooms that stand as tall as trees. I want to see one for real! Could you help me see a huge mushroom? You are a traveler: you must know how to grow huge mushrooms. Please find a regular mushroom from a place shielded from direct sunlight, and find a way to grow it into a huge mushroom somewhere where I can see it. Report back to me after growing a huge mushroom, and I'll reward you with a bunch of golden carrots. They are tasty, but I prefer mushrooms. Especially steamy, hot mushroom stew that waters one's mouth.
