Hi! I'm Albert. 'Scuse me. I ever so sowwy to bother, but could you help me? I've lost my little dog Rufie and I can't find him. He's probably ever so scared wight now. Poor Rufie isn't used to strange places an' people. You're sure to know him when you see him, 'cuz he's just the cutest little thing. Here, take this as well. His favorite chew toy, it is. He'll know you're a friend if you have it in your hands. I have a small reward for you: it's another of his chew things, but we can get more where we're going.
