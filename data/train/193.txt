### Response:
When a client needs us to eliminate another, we don't operate like the Dark Brotherhood. We find alternate means to get them out of the way. We send you to plant some phony evidence in the mark's house, and then tip off the town guard... the rest takes care of itself. Sound like you can handle it? Go place an item as evidence inside Carlotta Valentia's home. She must have ticked-off our client badly. The client's impatient and keeps asking if the job's done. Can you get him off my back?
