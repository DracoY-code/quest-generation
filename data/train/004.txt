### Response:
I am but a humble merchant. Interested in a little business on the side, friend? I've a man who swears by his grandmother he glimpsed a white wolf up in the Cloudpeak ice fields. It was but a short ways south, and she be easy pickings for a smart sword. I'd pay you good money for its pelt, so it's a guaranteed sale if you go. Keep it in mind on your travels.
