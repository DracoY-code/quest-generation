### Tools: when Haelga sleeps with a man, Haelga gives the man a Mark of Dibella
### Description: I hate Haelga! It's everything about her. She's disgusting. I think she takes her worship of Dibella a bit too seriously. Do you know she's slept with three different men in the last month alone? What kind of a woman would do such a thing? Just for once, I'd like to see her squirm... to rub her nose in it. Actually, there is a way to do this, but I don't think I could get away with doing it. She'd kill me if she found out. You see, I happen to know after she makes love, she gives her partner a token of her affection called a Mark of Dibella. If you confront her with three of the Marks of Dibella, she'd be so embarrassed... well, I don't know what she'd do! Oh, this is going to be great! You need to get the Marks of Dibella from Bolli, Hofgrir and Indaryn. Not sure how you're going to do that, but try your best. Then just confront Haelga with them and the rest works itself out.
