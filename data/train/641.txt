<|begin_description|>
"Blair's Notes" by Blair  It was in the ice. Who knows how long? But it wasn't dead. And now it's hiding, here somewhere... in one of us. We found it in Bennings, but then Fuchs disappeared. It's still here, and it's looking for a way out. If it gets out into the world, it can infect everyone, everywhere. Three years, at most. Gods forgive us for what we've set loose upon the world.
