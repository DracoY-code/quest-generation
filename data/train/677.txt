Oh... You're that dark villain. This is just like one of my adventure novels! So exciting! Perhaps you happen to know Spook. He's a kooky novelist who lives in an igloo to the north. You should get along with him splendidly! And whole you are there, you could even get his new book for me. I need to know what events unfold in that one! Evil machinations need funding, don't they? Well, do my little book-fetching mission, and gain an enchanted book. I love books, but that one flew over my head... literally!.
