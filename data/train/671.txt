Hmm, I am Pheirkas and I prefer not to work with amateurs. There's a fat man by the name of Algernon staying at Feldepost's Inn in Beregost. He keeps a cloak with him in his room and I need you to get your larcenous hands on it and bring it back to me. I assure you that your reward will be handsome. Try not to kill him, just filch it off his person.
