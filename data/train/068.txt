### Response:
Regulus Terentius, Count of Bravil. So you're looking for a house to buy here in Bravil? Really? It just so happens there is a modest shack overlooking the canal. It's not much to look at, but the smell will soon make you forget how ugly it is. Pay me 4,000 gold, and it's all yours. I'll have my steward register the deed of ownership. It's squalid little shack, I'm sorry to say. Oh, and the place is fairly bare. If I were you, I'd head on over to Nilawen at The Fair Deal and get some furnishings. Or you could always eat off the floor... doesn't matter to me.
