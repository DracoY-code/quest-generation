I'll assume you're back for more work, because I don't see a big need to chat with you. I've got more for you. Important stuff, actually. You need to go talk to Lord Rugdumph gro-Shurgak. He's an Orcish noble. A fine man. Our families go back a bit. Anyway, his daughter is missing. Head to his estate and talk to him. Find his daughter. And mind your manners! I don't want you embarrassing me! Now go help Lord Rugdumph. And wipe that smile off your face!
