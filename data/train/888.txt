### Response:
Oh... hello. Sickly Bernice, proprietor. Don't get too close now. You might catch what I have. Well... it seems I am dying. Yes, these may be my last days in the Shivering Isles. That is, unless someone like yourself could help me find the cure. But no one has taken me up on my offer, even with the promise of a reward. Ah well, it's been a good life I suppose.... There's only one place in all the Isles to get the cure for what I have... Knotty Bramble. I'll mark it on your map. There, on the lowest level of the place, is a pool containing the cure: Aquanostrum. Legend has it that it bubbles up from around an old statue. Bring me back the remedy, and I will reward you well with a Circlet of Verdure. Here, take this special flask to collect the Aquanostrum.
