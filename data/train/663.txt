### Description: Caranya insisted on removing the Necromancer's Amulet from the Arcane University. She said it posed a threat to the safety of the Imperial City. While I do not doubt that Caranya was right, I question whether her motives were genuine. She seemed all too eager to explore its power. I fear she is not safe from the minions of the King of Worms. Caranya is at Fort Ontus; please, go there and return with the Amulet. Help her to see that she should not use the weapons of the enemy, especially out of fear.
