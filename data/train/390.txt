### Response:
We meet again. I have need of a very special book, the "Lost Histories of Tamriel". The cat burglar Theranis was sent hunting in Skingrad for this book. However, Theranis has not been seen since. The Gray Fox himself hunts for this book. I need you to find Theranis. Help Theranis bring back this book. If Theranis is unwilling or unable, bring back the book yourself. Go to Skingrad. The trail starts there.
