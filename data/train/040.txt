I was a villain, in my time. I broke into tombs and stole from the dead. But, one day, I realized how much pain I had caused those still living... and I swore it would stop. My comrades... my accomplices... felt differently. They lured me out into these desolate sands and left me to die. My spirit has haunted this place ever since, bound here by the weight of my sins, hoping for vengeance. But they perished elsewhere, beyond my reach, even though they are now spirits as well. Seek their leader, Captain Stillheart, in Plunder Cove, and show him that justice can still find him!
