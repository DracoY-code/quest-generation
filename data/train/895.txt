You are going to assassinate Hern. He's a vampire, and has blended into human society for years. He's never far from his female companion, Hert. Also a vampire. The contract is for the male, Hern. But you'll probably have to contend with the female, too. They both live in Half-Moon Mill. So for Sithis' sake, watch yourself. Face a vampire, and live to tell the tale!
