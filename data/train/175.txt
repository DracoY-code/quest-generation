Where is that ash sucking steward of mine? Varona! Have you seen Varona? I'm hungry. Find her. Tell her I want apple cabbage stew, with some canis root tea. After all, I don't make my own tea. I am a master wizard of the house Telvanni. Other people make tea for me. You are not my servant? Obviously not, or you would have a cup of tea in your hands. I supposed you want to be asked nicely. Very well. Please, oh hero of Skyrim. Please find Varona. I shall be ever so grateful.
