### Description: No one cares about libraries any more! Everyone just buys their books, even though they could read them for free! There's only one thing I can do to make my library more popular: exclusive books. I'd like to secure an exclusivity deal with A.R., a very famous novelist. She has just finished her new book, "An Interview with the Enderman", while staying at a hidden camp on a mountain. Could you please get to A.R.'s camp and convince her to sign the exclusivity deal? Bring back a copy of "An Interview with the Enderman" too. I'd like to read it myself. You can have 32 name tags as a reward, keeping things named and ordered is always useful.
