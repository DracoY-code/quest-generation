### Description: I was planning to enter the Watchweald Portal in the Old Estherian Refuge. Unfortunately the keys have been stolen. Goblin miners took one, and we believe that some slavers who recently moved into the area have the other. It takes both keys to activate the Watchweald Portal... and it is beyond my abilities to retrieve them. Recover the Passkey Ember from the slavers, and the Latchkey Ember from the goblins. You can use them to open the Portal in the Refuge.
