You want something from Malacath? Then, if you're smart, you do what I tell you. Lord Drad took my ogres. Says he owns them. Lying maggot! They're MY ogres! Lord Drad put my little brothers in chains, working in the mines. I don't like that. Get over to Lord Drad's estate. Let my ogres loose, and get them out! Okay? Get going! You get a present, Volendrung. Be nice to my little brothers!
