### Description: I have not always been a simple villager of Seaside Settlement. I was a pirate queen: I pillaged many a ship that linger the bottom of the ocean with my crew. Alas, my life was turned upside down one fateful day: my ship sank, and I washed up to the shore. A kind villager from this very village found me and helped me regain my strength. I left my pirate days behind, and settled down in Seaside Settlement. However, I'd still like to obtain my notebook from those days: I accidentally dropped it into the last treasure chest we buried into the ground. My adventuring days are over: you, however, are known to do odd tasks of more or less adventurous nature to others. I'll give you my treasure map: it will lead you to the buried treasure. You may keep the buried treasure to yourself, I just ask you to give me my notebook.
