<|begin_description|>
My leatherworks are selling like hot cakes! I'm so happy! It is a good time to expand my business out of this village. Traveler, could you help me finish up a trade deal between me and Wander the wandering merchant? You just need to take my contract to him. He should be out in the wilderness right now. You'll get a block of emerald for your services. My business makes plenty of emeralds right now, so handing out a few isn't a biggie.
