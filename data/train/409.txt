We've received a desperate missive. A citizen of the Rift has been kidnapped. The Companions have been asked for assistance, and we shall answer. Particularly when the pay is as good as this. Get moving. Find the kidnapped citizen at Faldar's Tooth and save them. I shudder to think what might happen if you're too late. Bring honor to the Companions and yourself.
