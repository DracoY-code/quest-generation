### Response:
Hey, kid, it's me, Hull. I woke late this morning and left my sword in the barracks before going on duty. If you want to get it for me, it's in the chest at the foot of my bed on the right side of the barracks. Quick now, before the Gatewarden catches me without it. You'll also find an antidote there. I think Dreppin needs one for old Nessa. You'll get 20 gold pieces for saving my skin from the Chief.
