### Response:
It's good to meet you. The name's Pyke, and I welcome you to my humble home. Please, make yourself comfortable. Since you're here, I was wondering... do you think you could assist me? I'm having a bit of a crisis. I was a Knight of the Thorn from Cyrodiil. As soon as I heard the gates to the Shivering Isles opened, I knew a threat was lurking inside. I made my way here and began exploring this strange place. As I was passing Fetid Grove, I was waylaid. Some dastardly Grummites stole my most prized possession... my medallion that signified my membership in the Knights. It's a small, round, gold medallion. On the back is the inscription "To Pyke, from Farwil". Could you bring back my medallion from the Grummites at Fetid Grove? I will mark Fetid Grove on your map. You could have Thorn Shield as a reward. Good luck to you, friend!
