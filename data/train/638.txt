I, Sir Casimir, know where you may find the Gauntlets of the Crusader, for I was the one who lost them when I was still alive. Though many know where they are, they are still lost. I believe there is something you must do in order to retrieve them. When the Order fractured, I followed Sir Berich into war, taking the Gauntlets with me. When it was over, I returned to this land. I attempted to return to the service of the Nine, but the war had changed me. I no longer had sympathy for the weak, or pity for the suffering. In the brief time I was there, I did more to hurt the Chapel of Stendarr than help it. It was there that I was cursed. A beggar who came to the Chapel each day for help tried my patience one too many times. I lost my temper, and struck him. My blow landed harder than I had intended, and he fell to the floor, dead. Killed in the very Chapel of the God of Mercy. I left the Chapel at once, of course, but the damage was done. I was weak, constantly weary, and lacked the energy to do almost anything. As proof of the deed, when I struck the poor man the Gauntlets slipped right off my hands and fell to the floor. Heavy as stone, they would not move. None could lift them. I suspect they lie there still, in Chorrol's Chapel. You must prove to Stendarr you are worthy to lift the Gauntlets once more. Seek out the priests of Stendarr in Chorrol. Perhaps they can help you.
