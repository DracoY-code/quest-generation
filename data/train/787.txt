### Response:
Old Gurke had his famous cloak stolen right off his back by a batch of paltry tasloi. Yeah, yeah, it's old news and if you make one crack about the Cloakwood being an appropriate place to lose it, at least, I'll put your liver on the menu. Now move on and let the next people in line have their laugh. However, if you happen to find my cloak, I'll give you 280 gold pieces for returning it.
