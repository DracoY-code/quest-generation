I'd like you to speak with Tar-Meena at the Mystic Archives. She is our specialist on magicka arcana, and has been helping gather information. I believe we have been asking her the wrong questions, taxing her too much with vague attempts to make sense of all that we know. Speak with her specifically about these Black Soul Gems. If she knows anything about their powers or creation. Her expertise in arcane knowledge and lore could be invaluable to us, if we can make proper use of it. She can likely be found in the Archives now, poring through materials on Necromancy. She stops only to sleep, at the Arch-Mage's request.
