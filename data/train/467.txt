After everything you've already done for Raven Rock, I hate to ask for more but I can't risk Councilor Morvayn being killed. The Ulen Family of House Hlaalu, a rival Great House, has placed a deathmark on the Councilor's head. I need you to start out by being my eyes and ears... search Raven Rock and see if you can root out these traitors. The best place to start would be Geldis Sadri over at the Retching Netch Cornerclub. If he provides you any leads, check them out before bringing them to my attention. I can't afford to make any mistakes.
