<|begin_description|>
Don't you dare to scratch my books with your breath! I have not forgotten your vile deeds. Why did you even hit me? You can make up for your violent nature, though. Bring me a book and quill, it should help with a little project of mine. I'd love to catalog my books in a more orderly fashion. Help me out, and I'll forgive you for hitting me. I'd even give you an enchanted book.
