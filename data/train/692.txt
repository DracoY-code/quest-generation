What's going on here is that we've been kicked out of our home. The Thirsk Mead Hall, up there on the hill. We were... some Rieklings have taken it over. Rieklings overcame us with tenacity and numbers. Didn't help that we'd grown a little too comfortable up there. Too much mead. Too many stories. Too few battles. Are you... offering to help? Some new blood should be enough to rouse these layabouts to actually fight again.
