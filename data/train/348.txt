Jarl Elisif the Fair is in charge of solitude. Poor woman. Losing her husband and king like that. It was a dark day for us all. Damn, that reminds me, I have a delivery to make to her steward, Falk Firebeard. He ordered a special bottle of Stros M'Kai Rum. You could deliver it for me. Save me a lot of trouble. Here. Take it to the Blue Palace.
