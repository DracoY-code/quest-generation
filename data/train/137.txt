You must be the hero I have heard so much about. I have a small task for you; it should be child's play for one such as yourself. There is someone I really care about. I'd like to gift them some flowers, perhaps some of those nice, deep red poppies. Please, bring me 32 poppies. You can gather them almost everywhere outdoors in plains and forests. I'll have 32 emeralds waiting for you...
