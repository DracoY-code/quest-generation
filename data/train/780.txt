I am called the Faceless King, and I have resided here since the Zeraphi and Ezrohir were one race. I was their king. It has been my dream to reunite them by accessing the Vault of Souls, but the Vault will not open without the masks of the royal line, which were stolen from me ages ago. If you can locate the Royal Masks and return them to me, I can unlock the Vault of Souls, and reunite the Zeraphi and Ezrohir! Please, my mortal friend... help me end this war.
