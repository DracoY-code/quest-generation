I am Edwin, a wizard, and I require you! (Yes, they will do nicely.) I would have you kill a witch, the witch Dynaheir. She is treacherous, but with your participation I foresee no difficulty. Last I heard of her, she was traveling to the west of Nashkel, close to the gnoll stronghold located there. Will you assist? The prize I offer would surely be beyond measure in your meager understanding. Your payment shall be one year of my services as a wizard. I am sure you agree that my guidance will be far more valuable than any monetary sum.
