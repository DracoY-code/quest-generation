Dear friend, this village is freezing cold, isn't it? This cold is turning my fingers blue, at least. You are a highly skilled individual. May I ask you to craft a campfire or two? First, you have to collect some materials: 3 sticks, a piece of coal, and 3 wood logs. After crafting the campfires, please give them to me. I even have something for you: 32 Blue Ice. It's slippery, blue-colored ice. I'm sure it'll prove useful to you, my friend.
