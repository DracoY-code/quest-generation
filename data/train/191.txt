Hello there! I wonder if you have a moment to help me out? My name is Nerasis; I'm a researcher for the Empire. I've been working on a theory that used Ember can be recharged, with exposure to a suitably large source of mana. My research led me to Tarroch's Rift, where the mana output ratio is... well, it's very high. The problem is that there are quite a few horrible monsters between me and the mana source. I would be willing to pay you to take this burned-out Spent Ember into Tarroch's Rift and attempt to charge it, then bring it back here so I can see if my theory is correct.
