### Description: Thank you for saving me! I'm Tirdir. I was buried by the men who kidnapped me! *cough* They held me for ransom from my family, and after my family had paid, they knocked me out. I remember being carried here and thrown into that grave next to another body! And then they buried me alive! *cough* I don't know their names. There were three of them. The youngest carried me here. He dressed all in red... strange and bright as you please. I woke up with this in my hand. I think I must have torn it off his shirt when he threw me in the grave. Perhaps it will help you find him. You must stop them! I beg of you! There was someone who spoke to this man. Perhaps the gravekeeper. You should talk to him at least... he must have seen something!
