Oh, hello! It's me, Phlydia! Have you seen my copy of "The History of Halruaa" anywhere? You know how I can't stand the constant shuffling of arthritic feet up in the library... So I thought I'd get a bit of fresh air just east of here and... Oh, I hate being so absent-minded! Please, if you find it, I really do need it back. If you do, you can take this little gem of mine. Maybe a merchant will give you a little something for it.
