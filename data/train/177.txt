### Description: I have got another job for you. It's a sensitive one. I need you to find Viranus Donton. I sent him on a mission to Forsaken Mine. He and some others were supposed to clear the place of trolls. Haven't heard back from them in days. I want you to go check it out. I don't need to tell you how sensitive a matter this is.
