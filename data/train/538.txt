### Response:
Hello again! I'd like the thank you again for taming a cat for me. I'm really happy about my cat. There is a small issue, though. I hate to trouble you further, but could you get me a lead? I just don't want my cat to wander off to dangerous places all alone. Did you know that you can craft a lead by combining some string with a slimeball? I'll even pay you five emeralds for the lead.
