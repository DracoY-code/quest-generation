There's a plot. Not against me. Against all of Falkreath. Those Imperial bastards are spying on every one of us. Last night I saw Lod the blacksmith writing a letter. Probably sending word to Solitude and General Tullius. Are you loyal to Skyrim? Break into Lod's house and get that letter. The Empire is probably making Lod smith up more swords and armor for them.
