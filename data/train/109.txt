### Response:
There's a perfect job for you, my newest and only Noble in the realm! A messenger told me that Order has attacked my army's stronghold at Brellach and routed my soldiers! If Order has truly entered my army's stronghold, things have taken a disturbing turn. It means Order has tried subterfuge... not its strong suit. Amazing! Perhaps things aren't going as poorly as I'd imagined. You'll want to get all the details from the messenger. Unless you already have. You haven't, have you?
