### Response:
It is good to see you again, my patron. I have managed to gather together a play as well as a troupe of actors, as I promised. They are a fine lot. I have worked with some, and they should serve well. As for the play, I have come across a translated copy of, uh, "The Sorcerer's Bane." You will like it, my patron. A grand epic about the pride of a great sorcerer and the love that is his downfall. Seldom performed, but well attended when it is. The only problem I am having is deciding who will play Karenina, the lead female role. There are two actresses in the troupe who are desperate for the part. I know them both well and cannot decide, so I shall leave the choice to you. Here... I shall introduce you to both of them, as well as the rest of the actors.
