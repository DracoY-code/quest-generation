Hail friend! It's good to see you. I'd offer you something to drink, but I'm running low on refreshments, and quite thirsty myself. We are in a desert, after all. There's not much water around... Now that I think of it... You could actually help the whole Desert Refuge by obtaining us a permanent source of water! Build us a well, please. Ahh, I can already taste the fresh water on my lips... I could give you this bucket of lava in exchange for a well. Just don't do anything mischievous with it, or burn yourself!
