Most of the establishments in Skyrim keep their transactions recorded within business ledgers. Your job would be to change the numbers in those books so the shortfalls from our other jobs look legit. In this case, we want to waylay a shipment on the way from this business without them even noticin' anything went missin'. Feel like doing a bit of writin' in Bits and Pieces in Solitude?
