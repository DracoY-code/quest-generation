The Guild has received a 'request' to obtain a unique statuette. It is a bust of Llathasa Indarys, the recently slain Countess of Cheydinhal. You will be paid a modest sum. Do you want this job? Travel to Cheydinhal, and ask the beggars for more information about the bust. Bring it back to me once you have it.
