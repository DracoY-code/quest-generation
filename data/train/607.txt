There is a place at the end of all, far away from this village. A perfect place for a person of a more.. dark disposition. This place is called The End. It is said that you can enter it from a stronghold. The End is is said to be ruled over by a beast called the Ender Dragon: I'd like you check out whether the Ender Dragon truly exists. Oh, I did not mention the best part yet: there are wonderful treasures in The End.
