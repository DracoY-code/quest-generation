### Response:
You are going on a little vacation in Falkreath. You'll be able to enjoy the sights, sample the food... and kill the housecarl, Helvard. You know what that means? He's the bodyguard to the Jarl of Falkreath himself. So be careful. That's sure to throw a branch into Falkreath's well-oiled political machine.
