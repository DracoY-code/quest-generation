There's a cave known as the Darkwater Pass south of here. It has its share of water pools and high falls. Those falls... dangerous place. A friend of mine, Derkeethus, thought he could find some good fish in the pools. Haven't heard from him in a long while. Could you try to find him? He might need someone to rescue him.
