We are the three dryads. You must help us get free of this... creature Irenicus! We are Irenicus's possessions, servants, and concubines. You must get our acorns back from Ilyich, the clan leader of Irenicus's duergar slaves. He is somewhere within this dungeon. Please take the acorns to the Fairy Queen who lives in the south end of the Windspear Hills.
