I am a farmer here in Seaside Settlement. Sometimes, I get a bountiful harvest of melons. I process most of the melons into glistering melon slices for clerics and their important healing potions. I actually just finished preparing some glistering melon slices. Could you please take them to the cleric in the village of Humming Hills? I'm sure she'll pay you for them.
