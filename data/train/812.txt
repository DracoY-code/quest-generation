Hey! It's me, Delon. I... I've found you again, my noble ranger! It's... it's so hard to find you sometimes! The... the village is in danger again! The Minister has asked for you! It's Umar! The witch! She's come back, and she's threatened to kill everyone if they don't go an' leave right now! The... the Minister says he will tell you everything!
